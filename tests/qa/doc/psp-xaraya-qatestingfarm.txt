Xaraya QA Testing sites

   Posted by: Roger Keays on Fri, 26 December 2003 16:46:01

  Requirements

   We have a number of xaraya sites where the QA team can test the most
   recent (and previous) xaraya release on their selected platform (e.g.
   FreeBSD/postgres, windows/mysql...).

  Why?

    1. To save the QA team from wasting their time installing software
    2. To cover a greater range of hardware and software environments
    3. To provide more permanent URLs for posting to newsgroups/emails

  Requirements list

     * The site(s) offer us URLs which we can rely on being available for at
       least one year after they have been made public
     * Each site is for testing on a given operating system and php
       version... e.g. xarbsd.ninthave.net or win32.xaraya.com
     * Each site has a number of database backends installed (currently,
       we'll go for postgres and mysql)
     * Nothing is deleted from the sites, if you make an unrecoverable
       mistake, just start up a new testing site
     * Each testing site is a unique subdomain of the operating systems site
       (e.g. roger1.xarbsd.ninthave.net
     * Each subdomain uses a database whose name matches the subdomain
     * Each subdomain is run off the same codebase, and which xaraya version
       you use is determined by the URL. e.g:
          * roger1.xarbsd.ninthave.net/xaraya-0.9.7/html/install.php
          * roger1.xarbsd.ninthave.net/xaraya-0.9.6/html/install.php
          * roger2.xarbsd.ninthave.net/xaraya-0.9.6/html/install.php
       are all valid urls
     * phpMyAdmin, phpPgAdmin available for debugging
     * No shell access to the sites (at this stage)
     * The following operating systems are supported:
          * FreeBSD
          * Linux
          * Windows XP
     * The listing of http:/// shows the xaraya version available for testing
       at this site
     * The listing of http:///phpinfo.php shows the output of phpinfo() for
       this site
     * No security compromise for the hosts running the test sites
     * Minimize hacking of xaraya core, and any hacks must not be domain-name
       dependant
     * Testing installations available for each 'full' version of the xaraya
       releases
     * BK stable and unstable versions may be desirable in the future
       (perhaps updated by cron and email sent when conflicts arise). This is
       low priority.

  Design

  FreeBSD

     * Hosted on osko.ninthave.net
     * Configure apache so that *.xarbsd.ninthave.net all resolve to the same
       directory at /var/local/vhosts/ninthave.net/xarbsd. To do this we add
       a separate VirtualHost directive with it's own VirtualDocumentRoot
       setting that resolves to the same directory regardless of subdomain.
     * Separate postgres/mysql processes running on non-standard ports will
       be used for the database
     * update DNS on *.ns.bytemark.co.uk so that all subdomains of
       *.xarbsd.ninthave.net are CNAMEs for osko.ninthave.net.
     * hacks to xaraya code base:
          * hack config.system.php to include the correct config file based
            on subdomain from /var/local/vhosts/xarbsd/config:

 get subdomain (first part of xarServer::getHost())
     include ../../config/$subdomain.php

          * hack modules/installer/install.php to save config files to
            locations based on subdomain (xaradminapi.php at
            installer_adminapi_modifyconfig):

     get subdomain
     $systemConfigFile = '../../../../config/$subdomain.php';
    

          * hack installer to use predetermined ports, hosts and db
            username/passwords for pgsql/mysql (remove input fields from
            template admin-phase4.php using <--- tags), and fix
            installer_admin_phase5 function from xaradmin.php to hardcode the
            desired settings.
          * hack installer templates to add messages about db host/port
            configurations
     * Check permissions on
       /var/local/vhosts/ninthave.net/xarbsd/{config,logs}
     * Create db users for postgres and mysql with the same username and
       password

  Linux

   TODO, but will be much the same as for FreeBSD

  Windows

   TODO, and I'll probably rely heavily on cygwin.

  PHP Xref

     * Hosted on osko.ninthave.net
     * created using normal mass virtual hosting in
       /var/local/vhosts/ninthave.net/xarxref/xaraya-x.y.z
     * Allow directory listings for this directory
   #ulid:62#

  Test Report

  Security

     * Try to set different database port on install (pg/5432) by using cgi
       variables
     * Can't see qa hacked passwords in phpxref source

  Functionality

     * Check xarbsd.ninthave.net for directory listing
     * Check xarbsd.ninthave.net/phpinfo.php
     * Go to xarbsd.ninthave.net/phpmyadmin
     * Go to xarbsd.ninthave.net/phppgadmin
     * Visit xarxref.ninthave.net
     * Run installer at http://first.xarbsd.ninthave.net

  Postmortem

     * The system will allow no subdomain to be used. Not really a bug, and
       not worth working around.
     * Fix PSP documents on ninth ave to more accurately reflect the PSP3
       process.
     * No way of supporting short urls ATM
