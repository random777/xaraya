    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        Several terms are used in RFC documents. This section tries to explain them.
      </t>
      
      <section title="RFC (Request For Comment)">
        <t>
          Outlines the proposal/idea for comment. Stakeholders comment
          as needed. The lead author collects comments and incorporates
          them into the document. Through the RFC process, additional
          reviewers/stakeholders may be identified. In this case, the
          RFC is also submitted for their review. When all comments have
          been captured, integrated/addressed, the RFC should represent
          the best available solution. This final RFC is then submitted
          as an RFA (see below) for approval by voting stakeholders.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="RFA (Request For Approval)">
        <t>
          In addition to the final RFC, the RFA should include a list of
          voting stakeholders and assignment of the prevailing decision
          rule (PDR). Generally, PDR will fall into one of the following
          categories: a. Project Sponsor (Approved by project sponsors)
          b. Project Leader (Approved by project leader) c. Simple
          Majority (Approved by 51+% of stakeholders) d. Unanimous
          Agreement (Approved by 100% of stakeholders) With the PDR in
          mind, voting stakeholder(s) review the RFA and exercise one of
          the following approval options. a. Unconditional Approval
          b. Conditional Approval (approved if XYZ conditions are met)
          c. Rejection If the RFA is not approved under the PDR, it is
          revised and resubmitted until approval is achieved. An
          approved RFA "rubber-stamps" a specific solution, it does not
          necessarily assign implementation resources and deadlines.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="RFI (Request For Implementation)">
        <t>
          Once a solution is approved, the RFA is expanded to include
          relevant implementation information (resource assignments,
          deadlines, performance measures) ... thus becoming an
          RFI. Once completed, the RFI is submitted to the voting
          stakeholders for approval. Generally, the PDR and voting
          stakeholders do not change from RFA to RFI. In the rare case
          such a change occurs, it should be specifically noted in the
          RFI. Once and RFI is approved, implementation may proceed.
