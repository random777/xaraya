    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Query Abastraction has been made necessary to give us the hability to generate
        efficient SQL queries which are portable across all our Database Pool. It will
        provide us a way to create queries without any preocupations about the
        underlying storage system.
      </t>
    </section>
    <!-- One content section is mandatory -->
    <section title="Pros">
      <t>
         "Allows for the creation of queries in a persistent storage neutral manner.
         Expressed as objects, queries remain consistent across multiple persistent
         storage solutions. Should the database change from RDB to an OODB " or even to
         XML Based Query Languages (A lot of research is being done in the field[?,?,?]),
         "no part of the application will need to be modified." Reference [?]

    <section title="Requirements List">
      <t>
         The following is list for sugestions about the implementaion of the Query Abstraction.
         Please add your own.
      </t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Turn Xaraya completely database agnostic. [Main reason to be implementing this]</t>
        <t>As we already have a DB Abstraction Library (ADODB), this should be an extension of it. [Gary]</t>
        <t>Devs should be able to keep using their known SQL for simple queries, where portability is not
           a problem. [LadyofDragons]</t>
        <t>The query structure should be able to be passed around the program and receive input from
           many different modules. [Nuncanada]</t>
      </list>
    </section>

    <section title="Possible Implementations Reasearch">
      <t>
         There just a few query abstraction packages for PHP, 2 found in the PEAR archives. Both
         have serious shortcomings to our needs (DB_DataObjects and DB_QueryTool).
         Both were made without taking in account the necessity to handle multiple DBs.
      </t>
      <t>
         Research done in other languages for inspiration has shown that most query abstractor out there
         have too simplistic approaches, mainly:
      </t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Simplistic - They simply support the most basic features of the SELECT query, where the own SQL
           language is already the basic abstraction.</t>
        <t>Placeholders - They simply store 'common' queries with wildcards showing where the input values
           should be added. Clearly this doesnt produce DB independent SQL. </t>
        <t>Stored queries - They store the DB-specific query in files to be called, would be a similar system
           to that of using our MLS system to translate SQL queries to a specific DB dialect.
           This requires you to know how to implement the query in every DB, and although it is able to
           support more complex queries than the simplitic approach, it still falls short from being
           able to translate the hairy stuff</t>
      </list>
    </section>

    <!-- One content section is mandatory -->
    <section title="Implementation Idea">
      <t>The following is where the proposed implementation itself is shown</t>
      <t>
         There should be two separate concepts, that of the query structure which preferebly would
         be a class used only to hold the devs wishes, and drivers to take this annotated wish list
         and transform it into a proper query.
      </t>
      <t> The basic idea is a simple one, you will have a class (our query abstraction class) which
          will *hold* (with pointers, creating a rigid structure of relations) what the developer
          is trying to achieve.
          Then when he thinks he already has everything he wants in the 'shopping list', this
          structured list will be passed over to a specific DB driver which will translate the given
          structure in the best possible query for the developer.

             Although the research is towards a proxy for the database system, our query abstraction
             could be able to modularly inform supposed proxies our query pattern / structure

            I personally think parsing SQL is the wrong way to do it.
            There are too many inconsistent ways to do it, not to say it would be an unnecessary complex solution.

            This is one of the features our query abstraction should have. It shows how the abstraction
            can add value to the overall solution.
