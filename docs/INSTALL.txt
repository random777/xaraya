Xaraya: adam_baum Beta (.900)
==================================

   Xaraya is an open source extensible management system
(CMS).  Xaraya started as a fork from PostNuke (http://www.postnuke.com) and
PHPNuke (http://www.phpnuke.org).  Xaraya provides many enhancements and 
improvements over the the two systems and is a complete rewrite from the ground up.
Xaraya is still undergoing development but a large number of core functions are now
stabilising and a complete API for third-party developers is now in place.

   If you would like to help develop this software, please visit our homepage
at http://www.Xaraya.com, or send email to info@xaraya.com .

New Installation
================

   Xaraya has a fully graphical install process to provide a simple set of
steps to get your site up and running.

   To install your Xaraya system run install.php from your browser to start
the installation process.  The exact url depends on your site, but for example
if your site is www.foo.com and Xaraya is installed in the 'bar' directory
then the URL will be

   http://www.foo.com/bar/install.php

   Follow the instructions in the installation script and when prompted for
either a new install or an upgrade select 'new install'.  The installer will
create the rquired database tables and obtain information about the super-user
login.  Once complete you should be able to start using your Xaraya site
immediately.

Upgrades
========

Please visit the Xaraya Support Channel for information on upgrading from 
PostNuke to Xaraya.

Caution
=======

   Versions of PostNuke and other derivatives often include plugins
that alter the database core tables through adding fields, changing names, etc.
It should be noted that Xaraya does not support any modification of the core
tables (those that come with this Xaraya distribution) or direct access to
the core database tables.  APIs are provided for developers to use for these
purposes, so that future planned changes will have a minimal impact on
third-party added functionality, and should be used at all times.

Common Installation Errors
==========================

None noted with first Beta release.
