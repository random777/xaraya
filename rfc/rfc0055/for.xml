    The &lt;xar:for&gt; tag is a control structure which emulates a
    for loop, like encountered in most programming languages. Based
    on a 'start', 'test' and 'iter' attribute, the child tags of the
    tag are processed zero or more times.

        <t>an identifier for the tag</t>
        </t>
        <t><spanx>start</spanx>
        <t>An expression which should evaluate to a value, which
        is taken as the initial value of the loop variable to iterate
        over.
        </t>
        </t>
        <t><spanx>test</spanx>
        <t>The condition to test the iterated value against. This attribute
        is a php expression which should evaluate to false or true on each
        iteration. The for loop stops iterating when the value of the
        'test' attributes is false. Again, when using comparison operators
        refer to the <xref target="tagdescriptions">note on logictags</xref>
        </t>
        </t>
        <t><spanx>iter</spanx>
        <t>The action to perform at the end of each pass through the loop.
        The blocklayout for construct is just as susceptible to infinite
        looping as any for construct in another language. In fact, the 'for'
        tag is almost literally translated into a for construct in php. Anything
        which can go wrong with a php for loop, also holds for the blocklayout
        variety of it.
