Some ideas for custom commands:

bk panic
--------
not to be used lightly, calls upon the local bk guru to solve an immediate problem


bk decision
-----------
See bk-decision.txt

bk tarball
----------
create a tarball from the repository, optionally specifying a revision up to which
changeset should be included


bk stats
--------
gather all kinds of statistics and produce some sensible output

- total nr of files managed
- total nr of changesets
- total nr of deltas
- changes per hour,day,week,month,any period specified
- csets per user
- most changed file
- most changed dir
- least changed file
- conflict analysis
- 

bk bugs
-------
see separate document for this

bk findclones
-------------
Find clones on the current machine. This command could search the 
local disk for the dir struct 'BitKeeper/etc' This will probably be
a repository. For each repository found a parent can be retrieved and
the hierarchy can be displayed on screen. It would be really nice if
we also could do this remote to produce something like the image which
is on the bk.xaraya.com page. Even better would be to automatically 
generate this image.
 

Undocumented commands:
======================

The following commands are undocumented, don't know exactly what they do, they seem
usefull.

bk _lines
---------
Usage: _lines [-ut] [-n<n>] [-r<r> | -R<r>] file.
Gives info about cset revs in which file has been changed?

bk shrink
---------
it shrinks something, dunno what looks like size of ChangeSet file

bk hostme
---------
Usage: bk hostme [-h<host>] -d -q -p<project> -r<repo> -s<identity.pub>>

This is probably in use at the central bitkeeper site which hosts projects

bk graft
--------
Usage: graft file file
