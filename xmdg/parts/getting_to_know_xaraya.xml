  <section>
    <title>Your Xaraya installation</title>

    <para>You have probably already downloaded a version of Xaraya and played
    around. If you haven't, well: let's give it a try!</para>

    <para>Download the base distribution and do an install for a public site.
    Install all shipped modules and stick to the basic theme (Xaraya_Classic).
    This will give a nice overview of the possibilities of Xaraya.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Files and their locations</title>

      <para>You can browse around in the Xaraya directory structure. You will
      first find some basic directories, but when you look further you can
      encounter several paths that you wouldn't normally see in a for instance
      static website.</para>

      <para>The Xaraya core is placed in /includes, /var, /xaradodb, /themes
      and ...</para>

      <para>The directory /modules hold all the extensions (modules). Make
      sure you have articles, categories, dynamicdata and example in there.
      There are more, but we will mention these in this guide. The module
      example is the important example module that will serve as a template
      for our module later on.</para>

      <title>Hooks</title>

      <para>Hooks are one of the nice key features of Xaraya. You will need
      some time to dive into the subject, but once mastered (and it's not that
      hard), you will see the enormous power.</para>

      <para>Xaraya uses hooks to let parts of the installation talk to other
      parts. The Site Admin can decide which hooks to allow.</para>
