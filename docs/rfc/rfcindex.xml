    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
	Several terms are used in RFC documents. This section tries to explain them.
      </t>
      
      <section title="RFC (Request For Comment)">
	<t>
	  Outlines the proposal/idea for comment. Stakeholders comment
	  as needed. The lead author collects comments and incorporates
	  them into the document. Through the RFC process, additional
	  reviewers/stakeholders may be identified. In this case, the
	  RFC is also submitted for their review. When all comments have
	  been captured, integrated/addressed, the RFC should represent
	  the best available solution. This final RFC is then submitted
	  as an RFA (see below) for approval by voting stakeholders.
	</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="RFA (Request For Approval)">
	<t>
	  In addition to the final RFC, the RFA should include a list of
	  voting stakeholders and assignment of the prevailing decision
	  rule (PDR). Generally, PDR will fall into one of the following
	  categories: a. Project Sponsor (Approved by project sponsors)
	  b. Project Leader (Approved by project leader) c. Simple
	  Majority (Approved by 51+% of stakeholders) d. Unanimous
	  Agreement (Approved by 100% of stakeholders) With the PDR in
	  mind, voting stakeholder(s) review the RFA and exercise one of
	  the following approval options. a. Unconditional Approval
	  b. Conditional Approval (approved if XYZ conditions are met)
	  c. Rejection If the RFA is not approved under the PDR, it is
	  revised and resubmitted until approval is achieved. An
	  approved RFA "rubber-stamps" a specific solution, it does not
	  necessarily assign implementation resources and deadlines.
	</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="RFI (Request For Implementation)">
	<t>
	  Once a solution is approved, the RFA is expanded to include
	  relevant implementation information (resource assignments,
	  deadlines, performance measures) ... thus becoming an
	  RFI. Once completed, the RFI is submitted to the voting
	  stakeholders for approval. Generally, the PDR and voting
	  stakeholders do not change from RFA to RFI. In the rare case
	  such a change occurs, it should be specifically noted in the
	  RFI. Once and RFI is approved, implementation may proceed.
