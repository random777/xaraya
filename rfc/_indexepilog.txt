        Several terms are used in RFC documents. This section tries to explain them.

      <section title="RFC (Request For Comment)">
        <t>
          Outlines the proposal/idea for comment. Stakeholders comment
          as needed. The lead author collects comments and incorporates
          them into the document. Through the RFC process, additional
          reviewers/stakeholders may be identified. In this case, the
          RFC is also submitted for their review. When all comments have
          been captured, integrated/addressed, the RFC should represent
          the best available solution. The status (category) of the RFC continuously
          reflects how the content should be interpreted. See RFC2026 (
          http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt ) for the 'master'
          process on which we base our meaning of RFCs. Obviously we dont have the
          master process implemented, but that document will give you a very good
          picture on how RFCs should be treated.
