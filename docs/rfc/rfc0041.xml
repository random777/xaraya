        This RFC describes the event messaging system used by Xaraya to date. The
        different core packages may register events and trigger them at a certain
        point in the system load process. The modules may define event handlers to
        react to these events.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In this RFC the mechanisms will be described which are currently used in the
        event messaging system of Xaraya.        
      </t>
      <ed:ins>
      <t>
        The event system is used by core packages of Xaraya to trigger certain events
        in the system. These events are dispatched to the active modules which can define
        special functions which can then act on those events. 
      </t>
      <t>
        This system co-exists with the hooks system. They are alike but the main reasons to
        have a separate event-system next to the hook system are:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The hooks live in <em>module-space</em> while we need signalling from the core as
            well
          </t>
          <t>The events are <em>static</em>, they are guaranteed to happen, while hooks are
            dynamic and can be disabled (or rather, not configured) by the site administrator.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

    <section title="Registering of events">
      <t>
        <ed:replace><ed:del>Any</ed:del><ed:ins>Some</ed:ins></ed:replace> core package<ed:ins>s</ed:ins> can define 
        events, also known as registering them, by calling the function.
        <artwork>
          xarEvt_registerEvent($eventName)
        </artwork>
        in its initialization function.
        <ed:ins>
          This function registers the name of the event in a global variable. The only place 
          that this function may be called is in a core package initialization part. This can
          be checked with bk -r grep xarEvt_registerEvent.
          
          <t>
            Not all core packages can register events, for example the exception system cannot. The reason for this
            is that the exception system cannot depend on anything but the basics in Xaraya. 
          </t>

        </ed:issue>
      </t>
      <t>
        The naming convention says that the event name starts with the core package
        name that registers it (the owner), beginning with a capital letter. The specific name
        then follows directly, also beginning with a capital letter. No spaces or
        special characters are allowed.
        Example:
        <artwork>
          xarEvt_registerEvent('ServerRequest');
        </artwork>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Trigger them">
      <t>
        At certain points in the system load process the registered events can be triggered
        by calling the function
        <artwork>
          xarEvt_trigger($eventName, $value)
        </artwork>
        with $value being an optional variable that can be passed to the event handlers.
        Example:
        <artwork>
          xarEvt_trigger('ServerRequest');
        </artwork>
      </t>
      <ed:ins>
        <t>
          This function always returns. It might be the case that event handlers do not exist
          or that event handlers do something funny. The system relies on the exception handling
          system to catch these situations. The xarEvt_Trigger function neither sets directly exceptions
          nor handles them from its callees.
        </t>
      </ed:ins>
    </section>
    <section title="Event handler">
      <t>
        Each module, in turn, can implement an event handler function, that will be
        executed as soon as the corresponding event is being triggered by the core.
        The function must be situated in the file xareventapi.php of the module and
        must adhere the following naming convention:
        <artwork>
          function {$modName}_eventapi_On$EventName($arg)
          {
            // event handler code, e.g. db interaction, ...
          }
        </artwork>
        Example:
        <artwork>
          function sniffer_eventapi_OnSessionCreate($arg)
          {
		  	    // browsersniffing
		      }
        </artwork>
      </t>
    </section>

        <ed:issue name="eventlist" type="missing" status="open">
          <ed:item  date="2003-02-27" entered-by="marcel@hsdev.com">
            Can we include a list of supported events. Better still, a list of 
            events we want with a marker which ones are supported / implemented
            and which ones are not
          </ed:item>
        </ed:issue>
        As soon as an event is being triggered somewhere in the core, the events
        system looks up in each module whether it implements the corresponding
        event handler. If so, the function is passed the optional variable from the
        trigger call and is executed immediately.
        There is no guarantee for call order in case there is more than one module
        that implements a certain event handler.
