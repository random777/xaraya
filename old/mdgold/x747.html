        Another way of accessing the functionality of other modules is by
        calling their functions directly with the
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>xarModFunc()</CODE
> function.  Doing this allows a number
        of advantages over hooks, but also a number of disadvantages.  In
        general, calling functions directly is more flexible as the module
        developer understands exactly which functions they are calling and can
        also pass additional arguments to the function to customise its
        abilities.  The disadvantages are that the module named in the function
        call needs to be installed and active on the system for the calls to
        work, and if this is replace by a different module providing similar
        functionality it will not work correctly.

        Using direct function calls to other modules is fine within a module,
        but the developer should consider the implications of this on systems
        that might not have the modules that they are using installed.  Also,
        even if direct function calls are used then the module developer should
        still call hooks at the appropriate places in the code to allow for
        other extended functionality to be added to the module.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
        An example of where direct function calls might be used within the
        Gallery module would be if the module developer wanted users to be able
        to rate various aspects of the picture displayed such as 'use of
        colour' and 'originality'.  In this case a simple hook would not be
        able to accommodate this requirement, so the developer would instead
        make explicit calls to the 'Ratings' utility module to display a
        number of separate ratings, each with its own identifier.  The hook
        call would still be made, which might also add a rating to the picture,
        but in this case the value could be considered as the overall rating
        for the picture rather than that just for a specific part.
