Notes for roottag scenario:


Postponed:
==========
[POSTPONED] adapt the meta block to use the right content type in the meta equiv part
This is not that trivial in our current setup. The module space stuff is done
first, at which time the content type for the http-equiv isn't known yet.
In the tpl_order scenario this could be solved, but now, the information just
isn't known yet, lets hope the actual header takes precedence over the meta
tag by browsers.
[POSTPONED] test much better what happens when there is no xar:blocklayout tag at all.
(at the moment, at least mozilla renders properly, defaulting to text/html, iso8859-1,
maybe due to the metablock)

Done:
=====
[DONE] - the version attribute is required
[DONE] - the default value of the content type is text/html
[DONE] - adapting the RSS page template
[DONE] - anything before xar:blocklayout is NOT part of the output generation
but part of the template.  Example: <?xml version="1.0"?> before
xar:blocklayout designates the format of the template, it has nothing
to do with the xml header for the output. In this respect the current
BLcompiler is wrong.  (and incapable of determining where the output
generation should start, as we have no roottag at the moment)
[DONE] - testing for a proper closing tag for xar:blocklayout
[DONE] - xar:blocklayout tag can only occur once in *a* template, period.
[DONE] - a xar:blocklayout tag can only appear in a page template, not in module templates or block templates
[DONE] - it must occur before all other tags in our namespace as it is the root tag
