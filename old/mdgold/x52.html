        Xaraya is an alpha product and very much a work in progress.  There
        are a number of areas that are currently still under redesign, and when
        the redesign and resultant new code is in place module developers will
        need to change their code to be able to support the latest functions.
        Any change of these areas will have at least one full release cycle
        where both old and new style code is supported so the transition period
        will always be a matter of months. All efforts will be made to keep
        the changes as simple as possible.

      </P

        Areas that are still defined as to be upgraded before the 1.0 release
        are as follows:

            The multilingual system. The current multilingual system uses
            defines, which does not lend itself to high levels of flexibility.
            This will be solved through some sort of functional interface into
            the multilingual system, although the details are yet to be
            defined. The change should involve developers replacing their
            current _LANGUAGE defines with function calls but should be a
            relatively simple search and replace operation without changing any
            logic within the modules.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
            The hooks system. The hooks system is very new to Xaraya, and it
            is already recognised that it will require some extra work.  The
            most obvious addition is to allow hooks access to module content,
            but others might be required as well. This should require minimal
            changes to development modules, but developers should be aware of
            this up-coming change both when using and coding hooks.
