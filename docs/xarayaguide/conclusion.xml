  <para>Thank you for reading the Official Xaraya Installation and Getting
  Started Guide! </para>

  <para>I sincerely hope that this Guide has increased your understanding of
  how Xaraya functions, and that it has helped you to install and configure
  your own Xaraya site. Writing this Guide has been largely a solo effort that
  I undertook gladly. It is my pleasure to be able to give something back to
  the Xaraya community; the community has provided a product with which it has
  been a great pleasure to work.</para>

  <para>I am very interested in hearing your comments and suggestions about
  this Guide. Please get in touch with me using one of the methods below:</para>
