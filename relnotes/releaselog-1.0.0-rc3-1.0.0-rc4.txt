Release notes for release 1.0.0-RC4

Note:
  Due to migration from bitkeeper to monotone, these releasenotes are
  compiled manually based on the LARGE output of the log. While this
  is obviously more manual work for us, the large changelogs are really
  only interesting for developers which already are using monotone and
  could generate this log themselves. 
  From this point on we will try to do our best to summarize the changes
  into the releasenotes where the items will have a more general description
  than the full details on the changes.

  release 1.0.0-RC4
