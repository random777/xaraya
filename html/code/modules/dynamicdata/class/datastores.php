    As this file was long in the 1.x series i've split it up into 2 parts
    in such a way that is not the nicest in coding practices, but makes merges
    if we receive changes from upwards easy to do (i.e. reject all)
    Over time this will probably change. For now i just made sure that everyone
    can still reach the same stuff as before.
