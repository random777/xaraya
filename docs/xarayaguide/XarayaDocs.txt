INTRODUCTION BY JOHN COX
========================
Someday...

ABOUT THIS GUIDE
================
This Guide will assist you with installing, configuring, running, and maintaining a Xaraya Community Site. It is intended for Xaraya installers or those individuals interested in Xaraya installation and configuration issues.

This Guide is designed to be read from start to finish. Certain sections may be skipped (for example, if you're upgrading, you may not need to read the first-time installation instructions). However, reading this entire Guide from start to finish will provide the maximum educational benefit.

Throughout this Guide, we use several terms that should be understood.
	* <webdir>: This is the local directory on your site from which pages are served by the webserver. If you're using a modern Red Hat installation, for example, your <webdir> is usually /var/www/html. Consult your operating system manual for information on determining your <webdir>.

	* <xarroot>: This is the local directory on your site in which Xaraya is installed. If you choose to install your <xarroot> into your <webdir>, then the two terms have the same meaning -- they point to the same directory. However, if your <webdir> is /var/www/html, and you install Xaraya into a sub-directory called "xaraya", then your <xarroot> is /var/www/html/xaraya.

	* http://www.mywebsite.com: This URL is used as a stand-in for your site's URL.

	* Anonymous users: This is a site visitor that has not registered on the site or has not logged into the site.

	* Registered users: This is a site visitor that has registered on the site and has logged in.

	* Site administrator: This is a user that has been given administration access on the site. Most sites will have only one main site administrator. Some sites will have a site administration team.

FILES INCLUDED WITH THIS GUIDE
==============================
The following files are included with this guide.

	- guide_images directory -- These are graphic files used by this Guide. It is not necessary to copy these files to your Xaraya installation.

	- images/recipes/NoPhoto.gif -- Used in the Recipe Publication Type example (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). Displayed when no recipe photograph is available. Copy to <xarroot>/images/recipes directory, creating directories as necessary.

	- images/recipes/applechestnutsoup.jpg -- Used in the Recipe Publication Type example (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). Photograph for the SampleRecipe.txt file. Copy to <xarroot>/images/recipes directory, creating directories as necessary.

	- modules/articles/xartemplates/user-display-recipes.xd -- Used in the Recipe Publication Type example (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). Template for displaying the new Recipe Publication Type. For a default site-wide template, copy to <xarroot>/modules/articles/xartemplates directory, creating directories as necessary.

	- modules/articles/xartemplates/user-summary-recipes.xd -- Used in the Recipe Publication Type example (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). Template for displaying the new Recipe Publication Type. For a default site-wide template, copy to <xarroot>/modules/articles/xartemplates directory, creating directories as necessary.

	- modules/categories/xarimages/*.jpg -- Category files for use with the categories created in the new Recipe Publication Type (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). For site-wide use, copy these files to <xarroot>/modules/categories/xarimages.

	- Tutorials/PubType/SampleRecipe.txt -- Used in the Recipe Publication Type example (see EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data). A sample recipe to add at the end of the Recipe Publication Type example (and a darned good recipe too!).

PROJECT DEDICATIONS
===================
The Xaraya Project is dedicated to the memory of Greg Allen (adam_baum), March 6, 1973-June 16, 2001. Xaraya is his legacy.

Drew dedicates this Guide to my darling Wendy, the keeper of my heart and the delight of my eyes.

HOW IS XARAYA PRONOUNCED?
=========================
It is not as difficult as it may look. In fact, saying Xaraya is actually sort of fun. Phonetically, it looks like this: Zuh-rye-ah.

To hear Xaraya pronounced by Xaraya Team member Marie Altobelli (LadyofDragons), visit http://www.xaraya.com/xcommon/media/xaraya.wav.

WHAT DOES "XARAYA" MEAN?
========================
The name Xaraya was selected by the development team after an internal contest. Submitted by Marty Vance (Dracos), Xaraya does not really mean anything. We were looking for a name which was both interesting and unique. Xaraya certainly fit the bill. 

That said, the word Xaraya is reminiscent of 'raya', the Spanish word for Manta Ray. The development team rather likes the nautical feel of that reference, particularly when one thinks of the Internet as an "ocean" of information. The Xaraya logo concept by Marty Vance, logo design by LaDalle Hunt.

ASSUMPTIONS
===========
Xaraya allows unprecedented levels of customization, so it is impossible to list every possible configuration. "Anonymous users" are defined as users that have not registered/logged into an account on the site. "Registered users" are defined as users that have registered for an account on the site and have logged into the site with their username and password. The "Site Administrator" is a person or group of persons who have administrative access to the site.

To provide familiarity with how Xaraya functions this Guide makes the following assumptions:
* That you plan to run a Community Site and:
	* Do not permit anonymous users to submit articles or post comments until they register.

	* Allow ALL users to read all articles & related comments on the site.

	* Allow Registered users to:
		- Submit articles to the site.

		- Post comments.

	* Site Administrator(s) have complete access to the site.

* That you have created a web-readable "images" directory in your Xaraya installation directory (<xarroot>/images). We will store any non-core and non-module images needed by the site in this directory.

* That you already have a working webserver (Apache or IIS), PHP 4.1.2 or higher (4.2.x or higher is strongly recommended), an email subsystem, and a database (currently MySQL) installed, configured, and operating correctly. The installation and configuration of these tools are beyond the scope of this Guide.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
The general requirements for Xaraya are driven by the software that you wish to run on the computer. If your computer is capable of running PHP, MySQL, and the webserver (Apache / IIS / etc.), then it can certainly run Xaraya. More generous hardware configurations, additional memory, and increased storage space will improve the performance and capabilities of the system. 

Make sure that your system meets or exceeds these requirements.
* Hardware Requirements
	- Processor & memory: Xaraya's requirements are less than the requirements of the software used to run Xaraya. So, if your computer can run an operating system that will run PHP, MySQL, and a webserver, it should be able to run Xaraya.

	- Network connection: A network connection, either Internet or Intranet, is very highly recommended, but technically, it is not required -- Xaraya will run on a computer without network access.

	- Storage: The minimum storage space for an installation of Xaraya is approximately 8 megabytes. However, this amount of storage leaves little room for expansion. It is therefore recommended that Xaraya is allocated at LEAST 25 megabytes of storage space.

* Software Requirements
Before Xaraya can be run, it first needs to be installed or upgraded from a previous version. Before Xaraya can be installed, there are other pieces of software that must be installed and functioning on your system, and additional pieces of software that you may wish to install.
	- Supported operating systems include: Linux, BSD, MacOSX, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Win98/NT/2000/XP, Sun Cobalt OS (RAQ4)

	- A functioning webserver (Apache or IIS, among others).

	- A working installation of PHP (version 4.1.2 or higher) compiled with MySQL support. PHP is the language in which Xaraya is written. Without PHP support, the web server would not be able to parse the PHP files and your site would not function.

	- A working database management system (MySQL 3.23 or higher or PostGRESQL). If you want to install Xaraya on PostGRESQL, you have to switch on TCP/IP Connection Support in the PostGRESQL server configuration.

* Software Recommendations
Some additional software packages will speed up your web site or offer enhanced features. You may wish to install these packages.
	- phpMyAdmin (http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net) -- recommended only if the site will be using the MySQL database system -- phpMyAdmin is a cross-platform free utility that can manage an entire MySQL server. Many users may not have root (administrator) access to the database of their hosted site. If that is the case, you will need to create the database using an online tool such as phpMyAdmin.

	- It is strongly recommended that a properly configured & working email subsystem (for example, SendMail, PostFix, QMail, ProcMail, etc) is installed on your server. Most hosted sites will provide this subsystem. It is beyond the scope of this document to cover the installation and configuration of this software.

	- PHP Accelerator (http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk) -- PHP Accelerator is free, able to deliver performance gains & load average reduction to rival or exceed the very best alternatives, and is the intelligent choice of script caching solutions for PHP-based sites.
		
* Tools You Can Use
You may need the following applications to facilitate your installation. If you need to download any of these programs, check http://www.download.com or http://www.tucows.com.
	- An FTP program

	- A Telnet program that supports SSH

	- An ASCII text editor

	- A compression tool (TAR, ZIP, etc.)

	- PHPdev (http://www.firepages.com.au) -- PHPdev preconfigured version of Apache / PHP / MySQL for Windows. After installing you should be able to start creating PHP / MySQL web-applications right away.

	- PHPTriad (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad) -- PHPTriad installs a complete working PHP/MySQL server environment on Windows platforms (9x/NT). Installs PHP, Perl, MySQL, Apache, and PHPMyAdmin. 
		
	- FoxServ (http://www.foxserv.net) -- FoxServ is an extremely handy tool for Xaraya users to get Apache / MySQL / PHP / Perl up and running quickly, particularly for Windows servers. 

	- Apache Toolbox (http://www.apachetoolbox.com) -- Apache Toolbox is a fully customizable and menu driven script for Linux that will install Apache / MySQL / PHP / PERL, and much more. Everything is compiled from source. This is an advanced tool for Linux. 

GETTING XARAYA
==============
Xaraya is distributed in three pieces, the "Core", the "Base", and "Full". The most current version of Xaraya is always available at http://www.xaraya.com.

	* The "Xaraya Core" distribution is the absolute minimum installation of Xaraya.

	* The "Xaraya Base" distribution is the recommended installation for most users because it includes all the files of the "Base" distribution, plus several useful modules. This Guide recommends installation of the Xaraya Base distribution.

	* The "Xaraya Full" distribution contains more modules that further extend the functionality of Xaraya beyond the "Core" or "Base" installation.

Modules may be added to your site at any time after installation.

The Xaraya Base, Core, and Full distributions are available in ZIP (Windows) & TAR.GZ (Linux/OSX/BSD/Unix) format. Download the Xaraya Base distribution from the Downloads section of http://www.xaraya.com.

This Guide demonstrates the installation & configuration of the Xaraya Base distribution on your website. Later in this Guide, you are taught how to integrate additional modules into your Xaraya Base installation.

* Using the appropriate unarchiving utility, unarchive the Xaraya Base distribution into a temporary directory. Consult the manual for the unarchiving utility if you're unfamiliar with how to extract archives. For example, on Linux:
	- "mkdir /tmp/xar"

	- "cd /tmp/xar"

	- "tar -xzvf </path/to/XarayaBase.tar.gz>"

Directories in the Xaraya distribution
--------------------------------------
The Xaraya Base distribution consists of the following directory structure. In this section of the Guide, we briefly explore these directories.
	- docs: The documentation for Xaraya and components. It is not necessary to copy this directory to the webserver.

	- html: This directory contains the files and sub-directories that comprise Xaraya. For Xaraya to function, these files and sub-directories must be copied to the webserver.

	These files and sub-directories can be copied either to a sub-directory of the webserver's <webdir> (for example, <webdir>/<subdir>) or directly to the webserver's <webdir> (for example, <webdir>/).

	If you install Xaraya into a sub-directory of the <webdir>, your users will have to type the sub-directory name in the URL. For example, if you install Xaraya into <webdir>/xaraya, your users will have to visit "http://www.yoursite.com/xaraya" to get to Xaraya. If you wish for Xaraya to exist in the <webdir> (so that users will visit "http://www.yoursite.com" to get to Xaraya), copy Xaraya's files & sub-directories to <webdir>.

	- sql: Contains empty database definition files that correctly configure Xaraya's databases. Xaraya's installer creates the databases, but if the site administrator wishes to examine the data structure, these files can be useful. It is not necessary to copy this directory to the webserver.

	- tests: This directory contains code that is being tested and is usable at your own risk. Noteworthy in this directory is the 'import' sub-directory, which contains utilities to import data from other Content Management Systems into Xaraya. It is not necessary to copy this directory to the webserver. Pieces you wish to test can be copied individually to the webserver.

Edit Xaraya's configuration file
--------------------------------
* Using your text editor, edit /tmp/xar/html/var/config.system.php and make the following changes as necessary:
	- Database Username: The username that will be used to connect to the database. Do not use 'root' or 'admin' account names as they present a security risk. This user should already exist and have privileges in your database. For example, if the database user is "db-user", change the line to:
		$systemConfiguration['DB.UserName'] = 'db-user';

	- Database Password: The password that will be used to connect to the database. For example, if the database password is "db-user-password", change the line to:
		$systemConfiguration['DB.Password'] = 'db-user-password';

	- Database Host: The host name where the database server is located. In most cases this will be 'localhost'. Otherwise, you need to include a fully qualified domain name here, for example, 'mybox.mydomain.com' or the IP number of the machine. For example, if the database host is "localhost" (meaning that the database is on the same server as Xaraya), change the line to:
		$systemConfiguration['DB.Host'] = 'localhost';

	- Database Name: The name of the database to which to connect. Case-sensitive.
		$systemConfiguration['DB.Name'] = 'Xaraya';

	- Database Type: The database server type.
		$systemConfiguration['DB.Type'] = 'mysql';

	- Database TablePrefix: This feature is currently under development, and will be fully available in a future release. The tableprefix is used when you wish to run multiple sites off the same Xaraya database. The prefix specified here is prepended to each of the tables of your database to give each a unique name across multiple installs. For example, if the database table prefix was to be "xar", change the line to this:
		$systemConfiguration['DB.TablePrefix'] = 'xar';

	- Save your changes and exit the text editor.

GETTING XARAYA ONTO THE WEBSERVER
=================================
Move Xaraya Base from the temporary directory into your <webdir> (or a sub-directory of your <webdir>) to make Xaraya accessible to the web. The directory into which you move Xaraya is called the <xarroot> throughout this Guide.

For example, under Linux, with the following assumptions...
	* You wish to install Xaraya into a sub-directory of <webdir> called "xaraya"

	* That your <webdir> is "/var/www/html" (as it is on modern Red Hat systems -- users of other operating systems should check their manual to find the path to the correct <xarroot> location and directory)

	* That you have extracted the XarayaBase archive to a temporary directory called "/tmp/xar":

...perform these steps:
	* "cd /tmp/xar/html"

	* "mkdir <webdir>/xaraya" (or the <xarroot> for your installation)

	* "cp -r /tmp/xar/html/* <webdir>/xaraya" (or the <xarroot> for your installation)

If you need to UPLOAD your site, ensure that the files are transferred in 'ASCII' or 'Text' format.

It may be necessary to set ownership & permissions for the directory where Xaraya is installed.

Setting Permissions
-------------------
Now that you've installed the files in the correct place (the '<xarroot>') on your webserver, you need to ensure that all the files can be read by the web server. This is accomplished by setting ownership and permissions. Consult your operating system manual for information about setting permissions and ownership.

The recommended route is to change the group of the file and directories to the same group used by the web server. Under Red Hat Linux, check the "User" and "Group" settings in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to determine the user & group values. For example, under Linux and assuming that your user/group that is used by the webserver is user: "web" and group: "apache":
	- "chown -R web:apache <xarroot>"

	- "chmod -R 770 <xarroot>"

There is a file and two directories to which the web server must have 'write' access.

They are:
	- "<xarroot>/var/config.system.php": Set with "chmod 666 <xarroot>/var/config.system.php"

	- "<xarroot>/var/cache/templates": Set with "chmod -R 777 <xarroot>/var/cache/templates"

	- "<xarroot>/var/cache/rss": Set with "chmod -R 777 <xarroot>/var/cache/rss"

To set permissions and ownership on other operating systems, please check your manual.

* Clean up your files from the temporary directory. For example, under Linux:
	- "cd /tmp"

	CAUTION: Be aware that the next command will recursively delete the entire Xaraya TEMPORARY directory.
	- "rm -R xar"

XARAYA INSTALLATION
===================
Once Xaraya has been moved onto your site, you must install it before the site is available for use & configuration. Follow these steps to install Xaraya.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS OF ZONEALARM: If you are a Windows user and also use ZoneAlarm, be sure to DISABLE or EXIT ZoneAlarm before installing Xaraya on a Windows machine. ZoneAlarm may cause problems when installing Xaraya on a Windows machine.

* From your browser, launch http://www.mywebsite.com/xaraya/install.php (replace with the correct path to your Xaraya installation's "install.php" file).

	- Select your language from the drop-down list. Click "Continue".

	- Read & agree to the license. Click "Continue". If you do not agree to the license, you may not install Xaraya.

	- System Settings Check. This panel tells you if you have set up your system correctly to run Xaraya. It runs checks and determines whether you're running the correct version of PHP and whether Xaraya's permissions are set correctly, and more. If there is a problem, follow the advice given. If no failures or warnings are reported, click "Continue". If an error or problem is reported, fix it before continuing. Once you have fixed any issues, press "Check Again" to re-check the system settings.
		- FAILURE: PHP Version is less than 4.1.2.
			- This error can be fixed by installing a version of PHP that is equal to or greater than version 4.1.2.

		- FAILURE: The installer cannot write to the configuration file. Please verify that your webserver has write access to the var/config.system.php file.
			- This error can be fixed by changing the permissions of the <xarroot>/var/config.system.php" file, for example, "chmod 666 <xarroot>/var/config.system.php".

		- FAILURE: The installer cannot write to var/cache/templates. Please verify that your webserver has write access to the var/cache/templates directory.
			- This error can be fixed by changing the permissions of the <xarroot>/var/cache/templates" directory, for example, "chmod 777 <xarroot>/var/cache/templates".

		- FAILURE: The installer cannot write to the var/cache/rss directory.
			- This error can be fixed by changing the permissions of the <xarroot>/var/cache/rss" directory, for example, "chmod 777 <xarroot>/var/cache/rss".

	- Database Settings Collection. Review (and edit if necessary) the Database Settings on the next panel. The default database settings displayed on this panel come from the 'config.system.php' file that we edited in 'Edit Xaraya's configuration file', above.
		- The database types currently supported by Xaraya are MySQL or PostGRESQL. Choose the one that you are using.

		- Click "Create the database" to have the Xaraya installer attempt to create the database. Click "Continue".

	If Xaraya cannot create the database for you, see Appendix C: Creating the Xaraya database via phpMyAdmin.

	- Administrator Account Creation. This panel creates the site Administrator's account. This account has unlimited access to the site.
		- Enter Full Name -- the Administrator's full name.

		- Enter Username -- (required) used by the Administrator to log into the site.

		- Enter Password -- (required) used by the Administrator to log into the site.

		- Enter Password again to verify (required).

		- Enter Administrator Email address (required).

		- Click "Continue".

	- Available Configurations.
			- 'Community Site' prepares a site where Registered users have read access to all modules and Anonymous users can either read non-core modules or be limited essentially to the first panel (depending on the configuration option selected at installation).

			- 'Intranet' configuration is very restrictive where users who aren't logged in (Anonymous users) are limited to the first panel. Registered users have read access to non-core modules. There is also another group of users called 'Oversight' that have Administrative rights to everything except the Roles and Privileges modules.

			- 'Public' assumes a site where Anonymous users can do more than just read. They have the option to post comments to articles in non-core modules, while Registered users can be given moderate rights to all modules.

			- 'Upgrade from Postnuke' is currently not available.

		- From the list of Available Configurations, select "Community Site". Click "Continue".

	- Choose Configuration Options. Once you've chosen your configuration from the Available Configurations, specify which modules you wish to initialize via the installer. The listed modules are a subset of all the modules available for Xaraya, but this provides a nice starting place. For this example, select the installation defaults unless you have specific reasons to select otherwise.

	If you make a mistake or forget to install a module that you need, don't worry -- modules can be installed or removed at any time.

	- Click "Continue".

* Your Xaraya installation is complete! Click "Launch the site!" to go to your new Xaraya website, logged in as the Administrator.

Increase Site Security
----------------------
There are two steps that are recommended after installation to increase the security of the website.

	* To increase site security after installation, delete the 'install.php' and 'upgrade.php' files from the Xaraya installation directory ("<xarroot>"). These two files are not needed for normal site operation. For example, on Linux:
		- "cd <xarroot>"

		- "rm install.php"

		- "rm upgrade.php"

	* Change the file permissions for <xarroot>/var/config.system.php to "444" (read-only). This can be done by using the command "chmod 444 config.system.php" from within the Xaraya's /var directory. For example, on Linux:
		- "cd <xarroot>/var"

		- "chmod 444 config.system.php"

A Quick Look at Xaraya's Interface
----------------------------------
After the first installation, Xaraya's interface looks similar to other Content Management Systems.

At the top is the title bar of the browser which says, "Your Site Name :: Base :: Welcome" by default. Below that, at the top left of the screen, is the Xaraya logo which is part of the 'header' region. Click the logo at any time to go to the front page of your site.

Down the left side, since you're logged in as an Administrator, appears the Administration menu which may be divided into groups (Global, Content, Users & Groups, etc.) depending on your configuration selection in Admin->Adminpanels->Modify config. The Administration menu appears only for members of the Administrator group; regular users (anonymous and registered users) do not see this menu. At the bottom of the Administration menu is the "[admin logout]" link which should be used to log out of the site when you're done administrating Xaraya. Below the Administration menu is the Main Menu as it is displayed for regular users.

At the bottom of the browser window is Xaraya's 'footer' region. After installation, you'll see the Xaraya "powered by" logo, copyright statement, and your site slogan (which is "Your Site Slogan" after installation).

The large pane that uses most of the browser window is the content region. This is where the majority of site information is displayed to users.

Everything you see in Xaraya is configurable. Xaraya's powerful theme engine, BlockLayout, makes it easy to customize your site to your exact specifications. The colors, the fonts, the placement of information is all configurable by changing themes or templates on your Xaraya site. Don't like the Administration menu on the left? It's quite simple to move it. Want to put your own logo in place of the Xaraya logo at the top? No problem!

SPECIAL NOTE: Click-paths:
--------------------------
For the remainder of this document, we indicate where to click by using "click-paths".

"Click-paths" are a series of clicks you make in your web browser. An example of a "click-path" is indicated as follows:

	Admin->Blocks->View Instances

This example click-path instructs you that while logged in as the Administrator (‘Admin’), click the link for 'Blocks'; and finally on the next page click ‘View Instances’. Generally, the click-path is followed with a specific instruction, as you see in REMOVING THE REMINDER BLOCK, below.

REMOVING THE REMINDER BLOCK
===========================
There is a REMINDER block that is displayed on the left side menu of a newly-installed or updated Xaraya site which reminds the Administrator to delete the install.php and upgrade.php files from <xarroot>. Since we've already deleted those files, we can safely remove the REMINDER block. Follow the steps below to remove the REMINDER block.

Admin->Blocks->View Instances:
	- In the line with REMINDER in the title, click the "Delete" operation and "OK" to confirm deletion. The REMINDER block is deleted.

GENERAL CONFIGURATION
=====================
Now that we've installed Xaraya, we should begin to configure it. The Community Site installation, by default, does not permit Registered users to change their theme, to post comments, or to submit articles for publication (all features that we set forth as configuration goals in Assumptions, above) so these features need to be implemented.

Admin->Themes->Modify config:
See the section on the Themes Module (below) for more information about these settings.

Let's personalize the site a bit before we get started -- we'll do additional personalization later on. For now, we can change the name, slogan, copyright statement, footer, and default theme of the site from the Admin->Themes->Modify config panel.
	- Select default theme from drop-down list. The Xaraya Base installation provides only one theme, so unless you've installed additional themes, this should be an easy selection.

In the title bar of your browser window, you should see the following:

	Your Site Name :: Your Site Slogan

This is your Site Name & Site Slogan, respectively, separated by the Title Separator. Edit these using the Site Name & Site Slogan fields below.

	- Type your Site Name -- whatever you'd like the name of your site to be.

	- Type your Site Slogan -- this field defines the site's slogan. This slogan is displayed at the top of the page under the site name in some themes, and in the title bar of the browser by default.

	- Type the Copyright statement -- defaults to "&copy; Copyright 2003 <administrator name>". Change it as necessary.

	- Edit the Footer. The 'footer' is displayed at the bottom (the 'foot') of each and every page on your site. This is an excellent place to give credit, state copyright, or put links that you wish to appear on every page of the site.

	- Page Title Separator: Default is " :: ", but you can make it anything you wish by editing this field.

	- Page Title Order: Determines how the page title is displayed. For now, leave it set to the default.

	- Click "Submit" to save changes

Admin->Base->Modify config:
See the section on the Base Module (below) for more information about these settings.

	Website Display Configuration
	-----------------------------
	- For this example, set the Default Module to "articles" so that the articles module is displayed when a visitor hits the site. Select "articles" from the drop-down list of available modules.

	- Default Module Type: From the drop-down list, "User".

	- Default Module Function: "main"

	- Default Theme Directory: "themes"

	- CHECK "Enable Short URL Support" -- this is the 'master switch' for Short URL support on your site.

	- CHECK "Fix HTML Entities".

	Sessions and Security
	---------------------
	- Security level: From this drop-down list, configure the general security level for your site. If a user CHECKS the "Remember Me" box displayed in the login panel when logging in, the user's session is not purged for the duration set in the settings below. If a user does NOT check the "Remember Me" box when logging in, they must log into the site each time they visit. For our example, select "Medium" security.
		- High: Users must log on each time they return to the site.

		- Medium: Users stay logged on for the number of days specified in Session Duration, below.

		- Low: Users stay logged in 'forever' (well, it's not actually FOREVER, but a really long time!).

	- Session duration (in days): This setting determines how long (in days) a user's session will last before it expires, forcing the user to re-log in with their existing username and password. Set the session duration to "7" days.

	- Session inactivity time out: If Xaraya detects that a user's session has been idle for a certain period of time, it will expire the session. This setting determines how many minutes Xaraya will wait before expiring the session due to inactivity. Set the inactivity time to "90" minutes.

	- Click "Update Base Configuration" to save changes.

Admin->Base->System Information:
This panel displays a variety of information about the PHP installation on the site. Should you ever need to determine what version of PHP the site is running, or what modules are compiled into PHP, this is where to find that information. This information may be helpful if you submit a Xaraya bug report or a feature request.

OTTO: CATEGORIES -> MODULES -> HOOKS -> ARTICLES -> PUBLICATION TYPES -> DYNAMIC DATA -> ROLES

CATEGORIES IN XARAYA
====================
Articles are placed into Publication Types which contain Categories. Categories are an easy way to provide hierarchical categorization for all information on your site. You could use one or more common Categories across different Publication Types, or use specific Categories for each type of article, or any combination that you prefer for your site.

Before specifying which Publication Types will be using what Categories, create the categorization you want via the Categories Administration Menu. To get you started, a default set of categories was defined for articles when Xaraya was installed. You can adapt the existing categories to your specific needs, of course, or remove them altogether.

Once you have a set of categories you would like to use for your articles, go to Admin->Articles->Modify config, and specify the number of categories that can be used for each Publication Type, and the 'base categories' to be used.

A 'base category' is any starting point somewhere in your tree of categories, below which you will have the actual list (or sub-tree) of categories people can choose from when they submit or view articles. 

For example, you could have a 'base category' called Topics, with a list of different topics relevant to your site below it, and another 'base category' called Cities, with a list of cities or places for which you would provide regional news. One topic might be 'Good Restaurants', and one category might 'Brussels', so people would be able to browse through any articles about good restaurants in Brussels, for instance.

Editing and Creating Categories
-------------------------------
In this section, we explore how to edit pre-configured categories and create new categories. Categories are displayed to the site administrator in a "category tree", a listing that shows categories and sub-categories in an easy-to-understand format.

Admin->Categories->Modify config:
- If you wish to display categories in a Windows Explorer-like tree view, click "Yes". Displaying categories in this way requires a JavaScript-enabled browser. If you use this display method, the icons have the following meaning:
	- The "+" icon to the left of the category name & description expands or collapses the tree for the category.

	- The "X" icon to the right of the category name & description deletes the category and any sub-categories under it. If you wish to delete the category and any sub-categories, click "Yes" on the confirmation screen.

	- The "pencil" icon to the right of the "X" icon allows modification of category properties.

- Click "Submit" to save changes.

Admin->Categories->View Categories:
This panel displays all the Categories that are pre-configured by the Xaraya Base installation. Let's edit an existing category, and then add a few new categories from scratch.

Editing an Existing Category
----------------------------
To edit an existing category, click on the "Modify" link on the same line as the Name of the category you wish to edit. For this example, click "Modify" on the "Topics" line. This edits the top-level category called "Topics".
	- Name: The name of the category. For this example, change it to "Topics of Interest".

	- Description: A description of the category that is displayed to users. For this example, change it to "Interesting topics on this website.".

The next two options determine the position of the new/edited category in the category tree, and specifies if the category is a top-level category or a sub-category.
	- In relation to this category: Select an existing category from the drop-down list. This existing category serves as the reference point for the Position function, below. For this example, since we don't want to move this category, just leave this field as it is.

	- Position: Determines the placement of the new/edited category in conjunction with the "In relation to this category" field above. For this example, since we don't want to move this category, just leave this field as it is.
		- Right before, in the same level: If you want the new/edited category to be placed ABOVE the category specified in "In relation to this category" and be on the same level (for example, if the category selected in "In relation to this category" is a top-level category, this new/edited category will also be top-level), select this option.
		
		- Right after, in the same level: If you want the new/edited category to be placed BELOW the category specified in "In relation to this category" and be on the same level (for example, if the category selected in "In relation to this category" is a top-level category, this new/edited category will also be top-level), select this option.
		
		- The first child category: If you want the new/edited category to be placed ABOVE the category specified in "In relation to this category" and to be a child category of the category referenced in "In relation to this category", select this option.
		
		- The last child category: If you want the new/edited category to be placed BELOW the category specified in "In relation to this category" and to be a child category of the category referenced in "In relation to this category", select this option.

	- Optional image: From this drop-down list, select the image associated with this category. The image format can be any popular image file format (JPG, GIF, PNG, etc) and must exist in one of two directories:
		- "modules/categories/xarimages" or

		- "themes/[theme name]/modules/categories/images" for theme-dependent versions

	- Click "Modify" to save changes.

Adding a New Category
---------------------
To add a new Category, click Admin->Categories->Add Category. Complete the fields on the next panel, and click "Add" to create the new category.

If you are adding a large number of categories at one time, you can do so in a batch. Enter the number of categories you'd like to create in the "Create in a Batch" field and click "Reassign". This will refresh the panel with the specified number of category slots. Complete the fields and click "Add" to batch-create the categories.

	- Name: The name of the category that is displayed to users.

	- Description: A description of the category that is displayed to users.

The next two options determine the position of the new category in the category tree, and specifies if the category is a top-level category or a sub-category.
	- In relation to this category: Select an existing category from the drop-down list. This existing category serves as the reference point for the Position function, below.

	- Position: Determines the placement of the new/edited category in conjunction with the "In relation to this category" field above.
		- Right before, in the same level: If you want the new/edited category to be placed ABOVE the category specified in "In relation to this category" and be on the same level (for example, if the category selected in "In relation to this category" is a top-level category, this new/edited category will also be top-level), select this option.

		- Rigth after, in the same level: If you want the new/edited category to be placed BELOW the category specified in "In relation to this category" and be on the same level (for example, if the category selected in "In relation to this category" is a top-level category, this new/edited category will also be top-level), select this option.

		- The first child category: If you want the new/edited category to be placed ABOVE the category specified in "In relation to this category" and to be a child category of the category referenced in "In relation to this category", select this option.

		- The last child category: If you want the new/edited category to be placed BELOW the category specified in "In relation to this category" and to be a child category of the category referenced in "In relation to this category", select this option.

	- Optional image: From this drop-down list, select the image associated with this category. The image format can be any popular image file format (JPG, GIF, PNG, etc) and must exist in one of two directories:
		- "<xarroot>/modules/categories/xarimages" or

		- "<xarroot>/themes/[theme name]/modules/categories/images" for theme-dependent versions

	- Click "Modify" to save changes.

KNOWLEDGE REVIEW: Create Your Own Categories
--------------------------------------------
For this example, using the methods detailed above (editing or adding categories as necessary), create the following categories under "Topics of Interest" (to create this category, see "Editing an Existing Category", above): News, Announcements, System Information, Xaraya, and Internet. Enter any text in the Description field. Also, put these new categories in alphabetical order under "Topics of Interest" either by manipulating the placement using the available category positioning tools or by creating them in alphabetical order.

Categories Conclusion
---------------------
Once you have defined your site's Categories, they can be assigned to one or more Publication Types. We'll learn how to assign Categories to Publication Types, and what that means, later in this Guide. First, though, let's look at the modules of Xaraya.

TEMPLATES IN XARAYA
===================
OTTO Need a graphic or something showing the 'pecking order' of templates.
OTTO Describe how BLOCK & FUNCTION templates can be built into PAGE templates.
http://www.thedragonsforge.com/projectX/blocklayout_spec.html

Xaraya displays information to site visitors by using TEMPLATES. Templates are available in the following varieties: "function templates", "block templates", "page templates", or "block group templates".
	- "Function Templates" are Content Layout templates that display a view of a particular function of Xaraya. Xaraya separates function templates for users and administrators. User function templates have "user-" at the beginning of the template filename, and administrator function templates have "admin-" at the beginning of the template filename. For example, one of Xaraya's default function templates is called 'user-display-news'. This template defines the the layout of the news area in your page as it is displayed to users of the site. The administrator view is defined by the 'admin-display-news' template).

	- "Page Templates" are Content Layout templates that display a view of a whole page, which can include function and block templates. These files reside in the <xarroot>/themes/<theme_name>/pages directory.

	- "Block Templates" are Block Layout templates that display a view of a particular block within Xaraya. Block templates exist in <xarroot>/modules/<module_name>/xartemplates/blocks, creating directories as necessary (give new directories appropriate permissions). So, for articles, the block templates exist in <xarroot>/modules/articles/xartemplates/blocks.

	Customize default block templates with the equivalent ".xt" override template in the <xarroot>/<theme_name>/modules/<module_name>/blocks directory, creating directories as necessary (give new directories appropriate permissions). You also have specific override custom block templates that you name when you create a new block. The name of the template file (without the ".xt" extension) is entered into the custom template field when creating a block instance. These specific override template files are in the <xarroot>/<theme_name>/blocks directory.

	- "Block Group Templates" are Block Layout templates that contain a collection of individual block templates. The Block Group template files reside in the <xarroot>/themes/<theme_name>/blocks directory.

	- "<module_name>.xt Template" is a Content Layout template that overrides the default page template for <module_name>. These files reside in the <xarroot>/themes/<theme_name>/pages directory.

Function templates, block templates, page templates, and block group templates can be defined as either site-wide or theme-specific. It is advisable to make template files theme-specific by default. By doing so, you minimize the amount of work necessary if you decide to add additional themes to the site later.
	- Site-Wide templates: A site-wide template is used to change the look & feel of the site, no matter what theme is being used. Site-wide templates are overridden by theme-specific templates, if one exists. These files exist in the <xarroot>/modules/<module_name>/xartemplates directory.

	- Theme-specific templates: Theme-specific templates change the look & feel of the site only when displayed through a particular theme. These files exist in the <xarroot>/themes/<theme_name>/modules/<module_name> directory.

If template files exist in both site-wide, theme-specific locations, the theme-specific templates take precedence over site-wide templates.

MODULES IN XARAYA
=================
Xaraya allows items to be virtually 'bolted on' to its engine. These items, called "modules", add features or functionality to Xaraya. Because it is important to understand how modules function within Xaraya, in this section we explain how any Xaraya module can be installed, configured, deactivated, upgraded, and completely removed (deleted!). Any of these actions may be taken on any non-core Xaraya module. Xaraya's Core modules make up the distribution of Xaraya, and are not user modifiable.

The Xaraya Base distribution comes with a selection of popular modules available for use with your site. The Site Administrator may choose additional modules to use on the site. Additional official modules and third-party modules for Xaraya may be downloaded from the official site at http://www.xaraya.com.

Xaraya Modules -- A New Approach
--------------------------------
In other Content Management Systems, if, for example, you had a Reviews module and a Gallery module, they exist on the site as two separate entities that do not communicate with each other. If, for example, you wanted a Gallery that allowed users to post Reviews, you had to write your own custom module to integrate the two pieces.

Modules in Xaraya are different than any other module implementation because when they are 'bolted on' to the Xaraya engine, they can communicate with any other part of Xaraya, including other modules. These communication paths are easily built using "hooks" within Xaraya -- without coding -- by the site administrator.

In our example, within Xaraya, Review functionality could be combined with the Gallery without writing any code at all, allowing users to post Reviews of items in the Gallery. Further in this Guide, we will explore specific examples of how to combine the function of modules within Xaraya.

SPECIAL NOTE: Xaraya doesn't need an external "Gallery" module... Using Publication Types, Xaraya can be configured to display nearly any kind of data -- without requiring a special module to do so. We'll explore this more later in the Guide.

This section of the Guide shows how to initialize, activate, edit, deactivate, upgrade, and completely remove (delete!) modules from your Xaraya site.

Admin->Modules->View All:
This configuration area of Xaraya focuses on the modules of your site.

Module Listing: Display and Navigation
--------------------------------------
	- Style: Defines the display of the module list.
		- Plain (fast): Default. Displays an unadorned listing of Modules. Options (activate, deactivate, hooks, etc.) are listed as clickable text.
		
		- Icons: Displays a listing of Modules adorned with icons. Options (activate, deactivate, hooks, etc.) are listed as clickable icons.
			
		- Compact-A: Displays a listing of modules in a compact, two-column "over then down" format. The action & status list is displayed at the top of the screen. The letter indicators are as follows:
			- [I]nstall
			- [U]pgrade
			- [D]eactivate
			- [A]ctivate
			- [R]emove
			- [M]issing
			- [V]iew Info
			- [H]ooks
			- [C]ore Module

		- Compact-B: Displays a listing of modules in a compact, two-column "down then over" format. The letter indicators are the same as for "Compact-A" display style, above.

	- View: Filters the display to modules of a certain type as selected from the drop-down list.
		- All modules: Default. Shows all modules on the system.

		- All Installed: Shows only modules that have been installed.

		- All Active: Shows only modules that have been activated.

		- All Inactive: Shows only modules that have not been activated.

		- Not Installed: Shows only modules that have not been installed.

		- Missing files: Shows any modules with missing files.

	- Sort by: The sort order for displayed modules.
		- Name [a-z]: Default. Alphabetical ordering of modules.

		- Name [z-a]: Reverse alphabetical ordering of modules.

	- Hide: Because we cannot change any Core modules within Xaraya, we may choose to hide them from the module list to reduce clutter. If the "Hide Core Modules" box is CHECKED, Core modules are filtered from the module list and not displayed. To hide the Core modules, CHECK "Hide Core Modules" and click "Reload". Core modules can be displayed by UNCHECKING "Hide Core Modules" and clicking "Reload".

	- Force: 
		- Regenerate: When a module is added to or deleted from the site's module directory, the system needs to 'Regenerate' the file structure to recognize the change in the module directory. To force the system to regenerate the modules list, CHECK "Regenerate" and click "Reload". This is necessary only when modules have been added to or deleted from the site's module directory.

	- Reload: Applies any changes you've made to Style, View, Sort by, Hide, or Force and reloads the module listing.

Managing Modules
----------------
Below the display & navigation section is the listing of the modules on the site. Each module has a variety of information displayed next to the name of the module. We explore the definition of each piece of information, below.

	- Name: The name of the module. When the module has an "Active" status, click the name of the module to go to the module's administration screen. If you click the name of the module and nothing happens, the module does not have an administration screen. The administration screen of inactive modules is not available.

	- Version: The version number of the module.

	- Upgrade: If an upgraded version of the module that is newer than the installed version is available, this field displays notification.

	- Info: Click the "Info" link for information about the module, including contact information.

	- Status: Displays the status of the module. Status can be one of the following items:
		- Not Installed: The files for this module exist in Xaraya's installation, but the module has not been installed. Modules that have a status of Not Installed cannot be used on the site until they are installed.
		
		- Active: The module has been placed into Xaraya's modules directory and has been installed. The module is ready for use on the site.
		
		- Inactive: The module is not available for use on the site but the module's database and configuration settings have NOT been removed. Click "Activate" to make the module available on the site.

		- Missing Files: This module has files missing and will likely not function. Remove and reinstall the module to correct the problem.

	- Actions:
		- [Core module]: Denotes a core module. Since core modules are not configurable, no actions are available for this module.
		
		- Install: Indicates that the module exists in Xaraya's module directory but is not yet ready for use. Click "Install" to initialize and activate the module, which creates any database tables that the module needs and prepares the module for use on the site.

		- Deactivate: If you wish to make a module unavailable, click "Deactivate". This sets the module to an unavailable setting, but does not remove any data or database tables.

		- Remove: If you wish to remove the module from your site and remove any configuration and database tables associated with the module, click "Deactivate" (if necessary) and click "Remove". Clicking "Remove" removes all the module's data and database tables from the site's database. The module is NOT removed from Xaraya's modules directory. Modules must be manually deleted from Xaraya's modules directory to completely remove them from the site.
		
		- Activate: If a module has previously been deactivated and you wish to re-activate it for use on the site, click "Activate".

Modules in Xaraya
-----------------
In this section of the Guide, we explore the individual modules that are included with Xaraya. Not all site administrators will use all of these features, so feel free to skip around!

- Addressbook Module (Mod distro): Xaraya address book module. Admin->Addressbook.
The Addressbook module provides a configurable address book for your site. Entries in the address book can be made private (viewable only by the person who entered the item) or public (viewable by all users with access to this module).
	- Modify config:
	This panel allows modification of configuration options for this module.
		Security Settings
		-----------------
		- Access level:
		Grant Rights for an unregistered user:
		Grant Rights for a registered users:
			- View: To give unregistered/registered users VIEW access to the address book, CHECK this box. To prohibit unregistered/registered users from VIEWING the address book, UNCHECK this box.

			- Create: To allow unregistered/registered users to CREATE entries in the address book, CHECK this box. To prohibit unregistered/registered users from CREATING entries in the address book, UNCHECK this box.

			- Edit/Delete: To allow unregistered/registered users EDIT/DELETE access to the address book, CHECK this box. To prohibit unregistered/registered users from EDITING/DELETING items from the address book, UNCHECK this box.

		Other Settings
		--------------
		- Title of this Address book: In this field, enter the name of the address book as it will be displayed to users.

		- Default sort order / List View: Select two columns of your choice. This setting affects not only the sort order but also the display of columns in the list view. Users may select between the Default and Alternate sort orders.

		- Alternate sort order / List View: Select two columns of your choice. This setting affects not only the sort order but also the display of columns in the list view. Users may select between the Default and Alternate sort orders.

		- Name display in list view and sort order for name information: This setting determines the sort order and display of names in the list view. You can change the default «Last Name, First Name» to «First Name Last Name».

		- Special character (Umlauts) replacement for sort columns: Names and companies are stored in special sort columns for correct sorting when special characters (such as Umlauts) are used. This Admin setting allows you to set up the character replacement to correct the sort for each language.

		- Personal address book mode: The Address Book module may be used as a Global address book (UNCHECKED (default)) or a Personal address book (CHECKED). As a Global address book (UNCHECKED) all users with appropriate access may view records that are NOT marked Private. As a Personal address book (CHECKED) users may only view entries they have created and unregistered users may not view or create any entries.

		- Do you want to use a prefix field?: Prefix/Title (Mr., Mrs., etc.) values can be set in Admin->Addressbook->Name Prefixes panel and are optionally selected via a drop-down list when creating/editing an entry. This field is hidden (UNCHECKED) by default. If you wish to use a prefix field, CHECK this box.

		- Do you want to use images/logos?: Administrators will see a selection box of all files in the <xarroot>/modules/Addressbook/xarimages and can assign an image to a record. The image is shown in the upper right corner of the detail page. Currently, all pictures must be manually uploaded into the <xarroot>/modules/Addressbook/xarimages directory. This field is hidden (UNCHECKED) by default. If you wish to use images/logos, CHECK this box.

		- Disable the menu: If you wish to use the Addressbook module as a simple contact list, you can disable the menu completely. You can also disable it for guests only. Note, Administrators always see the full menu, regardless of this setting. Select from the drop-down list.
			- Enabled for all: Everyone can see the menu.

			- Disabled for all: No one can see the menu. Administrators always see the full menu.

			- Disabled only for guests: The menu is disabled for unregistered users, but displayed to registered users.

EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type
--------------------------------------

EXAMPLE: Adding a new Publication Type that uses Dynamic Data
-------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial assumes you are starting from a fresh, brand-spanking-new, just-installed Xaraya Base installation.

1. LOG IN AS A XARAYA ADMINISTRATOR: This is done any time you wish to have Administrator access to your Xaraya site.

2. CREATE A NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

To create the new Publication Type, go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Click "New". Complete the fields as follows:
	Type: recipes (NOTE: Lower case.)
	Description: Recipe Collection

	Field: title
	Label: Recipe Title
	Format: Text Box
	Input: CHECKED

	Field: summary
	Label: Description
	Format: Small Text Area
	Input: CHECKED

	Field: bodytext
	Label: Ingredients
	Format: Large Text Area
	Input: CHECKED

	Field: bodyfile
	Label: (this field should be blank)
	Format: (as long as Label, above, is blank and Input, below is UNCHECKED, it does not matter what this field contains)
	Input: UNCHECKED

	Field: notes
	Label: Instructions
	Format: Large Text Area
	Input: CHECKED

Do not modify the last 3 fields (authorid, pubdate, and status); leave them as they are.

Click "Create" to save changes.

3. ENABLE DYNAMIC DATA FOR ARTICLES/RECIPES: This is done for each custom Publication Type using Dynamic Data you create, unless Dynamic Data has previously been enabled for the module.

To enable Dynamic Data for a Publication Type, go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks. We want to enable Dynamic Data within Articles, so click "dynamicdata" and CHECK the box for Articles and the 'Recipe Collection' sub-category under Articles. Click "Save Changes".

4. ADD DYNAMIC DATA FIELD(S) TO THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type using Dynamic Data you create.

To add dynamic data field(s) to the new publication type, go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Find the 'recipes' Publication Type that we created in CREATE A NEW PUBLICATION TYPE, above, and click Article Config next to it. Near the bottom of the next screen, you'll see "Dynamic Data Fields [modify]". Click "[modify]" and in the new window that opens, enter the Dynamic Data as follows:
	Label: photo (NOTE: Lower case.)
	Property Type: Image
	Data Source: dynamic_data
	Status: Active

Click "Update Properties" to save changes. Close the window and return to the previous browser window for the rest of the steps.

5. ADD A NEW CATEGORY (AND OPTIONAL SUB-CATEGORIES) FOR THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

To add the new category (and optional sub-categories), go to Admin->Categories. Click "Add Category" to add a new Category. For this example:

Create a new Category called "Recipes Category" by following the steps below:
	- Name: Recipes Category
	- Description: This is the recipes category for this site.
	- In relation to this category: Generic1
	- Position: Right before, in the same level
	- Optional image: categoryrecipes_top.jpg
	- Click "Add" to add the new category.

Create three sub-categories: "Appetizers & Soups", "Breads & Baked Goods", and finally "Desserts". To create the "Appetizers & Soups" sub-category, click "Add Category" and follow these steps:
	- Name: Appetizers & Soups
	- Description: Soups and Appetizer recipes go here.
	- In relation to this category: Recipes Category
	- Position: The first child category
	- Optional image: categorysoups.jpg
	- Click "Add" to add the new category.

To create the next two sub-categories, click "Add Category" and follow these steps:
	- Name: Breads & Baked Goods
	- Description: Breads & baked goods recipes go here.
	- In relation to this category: Recipes Category / Appetizers & Soups
	- Position: Right after, in the same level
	- Optional image: categorybaked.jpg
	- Click "Add" to add the new category.

Create another sub-category, typing "Desserts" in the Name field, "Dessert recipes go here" for the Description, and "categorydesserts.jpg" as the image.

6. ADD THE NEW PUBLICTION TYPE TO A CATAGORY: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

To add Publication Types to Categories, go to Admin->Articles->Modify Config and click on the description of the Publication Type we created (in this example, it's "Recipe Collection"). Scroll down, and you'll see:

	Number of possible categories: 0

	Change the "0" to "1". 

Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.

After the screen refreshes, scroll to the bottom of the center section and select the Category for the new Publication Type. In this example, if it's not already selected, select "Recipes Category" that we created above. Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.

7. CONFIGURE THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

Still in Admin->Articles->Modify Config, click on the description of the publication type we just created (in this example, it's "Recipe Collection"). Make the following changes:
	Use 'recipes' as alias in short URLs: CHECKED
	Default start view: Browse in Recipes Category
	Number of columns ($numcols): 1
	Items per page ($number): 10
	Show category links in article summaries ($categories): CHECKED
	Show previous/next category ($showprevnext): CHECKED
	Show number of comments ($comments): CHECKED
	Show hit counts ($counter): CHECKED
	Show ratings ($rating): CHECKED
	Show links to publication types ($showpublinks + includes/publinks.xd): CHECKED
	Show link to archives ($archivelink + $archivelabel): CHECKED
	Show link to article map ($maplink + $maplabel): CHECKED
	Call transform hooks in summaries: UNCHECKED
	Show link to previous/next article in display ($prevart + $nextart): CHECKED

NOTE: Items enclosed in parenthesis above are the names of the variables used in templates.

Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.

8. ADD TEMPLATES FOR THE NEW PUBLICTION TYPE: This can be done for each custom Publication Type you create.

We can create up to three custom display templates to tell Xaraya specifically how to display this new Publication Type. Example files are included in this tutorial distribution. If you do not create a template, Xaraya will attempt to display the Publication Type using a default template.

Template files are placed into the <webdir>/modules/articles/xartemplates directory, and should be called 'user-display-<pubtype>.xd', 'user-summary-<pubtype>.xd', and (optionally) 'user-view-<pubtype>.xd', where <pubtype> is the name of the Publication Type (in this tutorial, <pubtype> is "recipes" as created in step #2 above):

	user-display-recipes.xd -- this is the main view of the data
	user-summary-recpies.xd -- this is a summary view of the data
	user-view-recipes.xd (optional)

If you wish to create theme-specific versions of these files, rename the files from *.xd to *.xt and place the theme-specific version in the <webdir>/themes/<theme_name>/modules/articles directory, creating directories as necessary.

It is recommended that you begin by examining the example files included with this tutorial, or open one of the sample templates provided with Xaraya and make changes as necessary using your favorite HTML editor. Where ever you want to display the fields in the new Publication Type, enter "#$fieldname#" (no quotes) in the template. Xaraya will replace "#$fieldname#" with the contents of the field as stored in the database. In this tutorial, we created the following fields, which are available for display in the template using the #$fieldname# indicated in parenthesis:

	- title (#$title#)
	- summary (#$summary#)
	- bodytext (#$bodytext#)
	- notes (#$notes#)
	- photo (#$photo#)

The templates included with this tutorial distribution expect to find a file called "NoPhoto.gif" in the <webdir>/images/recipes/ directory of your website. This file is displayed if a Photograph URL is not provided in the article submission, and is included with this tutorial distribution. Copy NoPhoto.gif to the <webdir>/images/recipes/ directory, creating directories as necessary.

9. ADD AN ARTICLE TO THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

Now you can add articles to the new publication type. Click Admin->Articles->Add Article and click on the name of the new Publication Type (in this example, it's Recipe Collection). A sample recipe is included with this tutorial (SampleRecipe.txt).

Enter the Recipe Title, Description, Ingredients, Directions, and a URL for the photograph for the recipe. Select the appropriate Category for the recipe, and click "Preview" to see what the recipe will look like, or click "Add Article" to save it.

On the following page, approve the article by putting a CHECK in the STATUS box, and selecting "Approved" from the drop-down list at the bottom of the page. Click "Change Status" to save changes.

10. LOGOUT FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT
It is a wise idea, though technically not required, to log out of your administrator account at the end of each session.

- Authsystem Module (core): Xaraya default authentication module. No administration panel.

- Autolinks Module: TRANSFORM. Automatically link key words. Admin->Autolinks.
Autolinks is a feature that, when installed, generates web links related to text content on-the-fly. If you have Autolinks turned on & configured properly, "Beatles" defined as a Keyword, and "http://www.beatles.com" as the auto-link URL, Autolinks in Xaraya will automatically replace occurrences of "Beatles" within your articles with "<a href="http://www.beatles.com">Beatles</a>". Autolinks is not active after Xaraya installation and must be installed through Admin->Modules->View All.

When Autolinks are installed, the option to hook Autolinks into particular modules appears in Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks. Hook Autolinks into the modules you wish, such as Articles, Comments, Ephemerids, Messages, and XarBB.

	- Add Autolink: Enter the keyword in the Key (link) Word field. This is the text that will be matched in an article (for example, "beatles").

	NOTE: Capitalization is not important in the Key (link) Word field.

	- Title: Enter the title of the site in the Title field (for example, "The Beatles Site"). This is the name that will be displayed as a mouse-over and in the listing of all Autolinks.

	- URL: Enter the complete URL for the site in the URL field (for example, "http://www.beatles.com"). Make sure to enter "http://" at the beginning of the link if the site is external to your site; otherwise it will not function as expected.

	If the URL is located on your web site, enter the path to the file or the complete URL. For example, if the file is on your site, enter "music.html" and Autolinks will automatically prepend the "http://www.yoursite.com", resulting in an Autolink of "http://www.yoursite.com/music.html". To be more specific, you could also enter "http://www.yoursite.com/music.html" instead of "music.html".

	- Comments: Use the Comments field to enter optional free-form alphanumeric comments about the link. Comments are visible only to the Site Administrator.

Click "Create Autolink" to add the Autolink to the database.

To view, edit, or delete Autolinks, click Admin->Autolinks->View. All Autolinks in your database are displayed sorted by Keyword. If you wish to edit an Autolink, click on the "Edit" link for that Autolink. A panel is displayed allowing you to edit all the information about that particular Autolink. An additional field, "Enabled", is available on this panel. See below for Enabling/Disabling Autolinks. Click "Modify Autolink" to save changes.

To delete an Autolink, click on the "Delete" link for that Autolink. A panel will be displayed asking you to confirm your request to delete the Autolink. If you wish to delete the Autolink, click "Confirm"; otherwise click "Cancel deletion of Autolink" and the link will not be removed.

If you wish to disable an Autolink but not delete it from the Autolinks database, click "Disable". The Autolink is not deleted but it will not appear as a link when matching text is found. To enable an Autolink, click "Enable".

Admin->Autolinks->Modify config: This section allows configuration of how Autolinks appear on your site.

	Matching
	--------
		- Punctuation characters: Punctuation characters are not permitted in URLs. This list specifies the characters that are NOT permitted. Default: ".!?&quot;';:"

		- Match non-breaking space entity as white space: "&nbsp;" is an entity that represents ' ', while ' ' is just a space. To match "$nbsp;" to a space, CHECK this box. It is generally recommended that this option be CHECKED unless you have a specific reason to uncheck it.

	Action
	------
		- Limit on number of times each link is used in a piece of text: Enter the number of times in a particular article that matching text will be converted to an Autolink. For example, if you would like a matching piece of text to be converted to an Autolink twice in a single article and subsequent matches would not be converted, enter "2" in this field. To convert ALL matching text within a particular article to Autolinks, leave this field blank.

		- Autolink decoration (style will override class):
			- Default: The default decoration style as defined in the site's theme will be used.

			- None: The autolink is displayed without any decoration.

			- Underline: The autolink text is underlined.

			- Overline: The autolink text is overlined (the opposite of underlining).

			- Both: Both Underline & Overline decorations are used to display the autolink.

		- Open links in new window: CHECK this box if you would like Autolinks to open in a new window. UNCHECK it to open Autolinks in the current browser window.

	Admin
	-----
		- Items per page: How many Autolinks would you like to display per page? Enter that value into this field, for example, "25".

Click "Submit" to save changes.

EXAMPLE: Adding AutoLinks to a Publication Type
-----------------------------------------------
Adding AutoLinks to a Publication Type is very easy. There are two different methods for accomplishing this task, and we will cover them both in this example. Be sure you have some Autolinks defined (go to Admin->Autolinks->Add and add a few) and an article that contains Autolink text so you can see the results of your work.

Method 1. Go to Admin->Modules->View All. Next to the Articles line in the panel, click "On/Off" under the Hooks heading. On the next panel that appears, CHECK to enable Autolinks in specific Publication Type(s), or CHECK the ALL box to enable Autolinks in all Publication Types. Click "Save Changes" to save changes. You have just enabled Autolinks to Publication Type(s)!

Method 2. Go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks. In the next panel, click Autolinks. CHECK the specific Publication Types in which you wish to enable Autolinks, or CHECK the ALL ARTICLES box to enable Autolinks in all Publication Types. Click "Save Changes" to save changes. You have just enabled Autolinks to Publication Type(s)!

- Base Module (core): Home page. Admin->Base.
	- System: Displays system information about your site. The information may be sorted by the following fields:
		- General info: Provides general information (go figure!) about your PHP installation, including the version number which is displayed at the top of the panel.

		- Credits: Credits for PHP.

		- Configuration: Configuration variables, directives, and options that are specific to your installation of PHP.

		- Modules: Modules that are specific to your installation of PHP.

		- Environment: Environment variables that are specific to your installation of PHP.

		- Variables: Other variables that are specific to your installation of PHP.

		- License: Displays the PHP license.

		- All: Displays all the above items on one giant panel.

		- Click "Refresh" to select sort order.

	- Modify config:
	This panel allows modification of configuration options for this module. In this panel, we select the default module that is displayed when a user hits the site. Select the default module from the drop-down list. For a general news or community site, a good default module is "articles". If you want to require users to log in or register before accessing the system, select "roles" as the default module.

	Website Display Configuration
	-----------------------------
	- Default module: From the drop-down list, select the default module to be displayed when a user hits the site. For a general news or community site, a good default module is "articles". If you want to require users to log in (or register) before accessing the system, select "roles" as the default module.

	- Default module type:
		- User: (Default) To load the default module in USER mode, select this value from the drop-down list. Unless you have a very specific reason to use Admin mode, User mode is the recommended setting.
		
		- Admin: If you would like to load the default module in ADMINISTRATOR mode, select this value from the drop-down list.

	- Default module function: Default="main". This is an advanced field -- most site administrators will not change this value. Enter the name of a specific function of the default module (above) to be launched when a user visits the site.

	- Default theme directory: The local path to your Xaraya theme directory, relative to <xarroot>. By default, it is "themes", which equates to <xarroot>/themes, but can be any local path where your theme files & sub-directories are stored..

	- Enable Short URL support: This is the 'master switch' for Short URL support on your site. If this option is CHECKED, Short URL Support is enabled site-wide, though it must be specifically enabled in each module (and each Publication Type under the Articles module) that you wish to support Short URLs.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE: Short URLs work without modifying your Apache 1.x configuration. If you are running Apache 2.x, see Appendix D: Enabling Short URL support in Apache 2.x for important information about enabling Short URL support.

	Short URLs are easier for search engines that crawl & catalog your site, and are easier for your users to understand & remember.

	Example of a Long URL: http://www.xaraya.com/index.php?module=articles&func=display&aid=2&ptid=1&catid=30

	Example of a Short URL: http://www.xaraya.com/index.php/news/2

	Long URLs ALWAYS work -- even if Short URLs are enabled. Short URLs function only when enabled by this switch & in specific modules. Therefore, it is generally recommended to CHECK "Enable Short URL Support" even if you do not intend to use Short URLs anywhere else on your site.

	- Fix HTML Entities: If text contains non-valid characters (for example, "&", "$", etc), they will be replaced with the correct HTML entity if this box is CHECKED. If UNCHECKED, non-valid characters will not be replaced.
	
	- Configure to run on Secure Server: CHECK this box to enable HTTPS (Secure Server) mode, which is useful for online shops or in situations where security is a concern. If your site will allow credit cards to be entered, you should CHECK this box. UNCHECK this box (default) if you do not need Secure Server mode.
	
	Sessions and Security
	---------------------
	- Security level: From this drop-down list, configure the general security level for your site. If a user CHECKS the "Remember Me" box displayed in the login panel when logging in, the user's session is not purged for the duration set in the settings below. If a user does NOT check the "Remember Me" box when logging in, they must log into the site each time they visit.
		- High: Users must log on each time they return to the site.

		- Medium: Users stay logged on for the number of days specified in Session Duration, below.

		- Low: Users stay logged in forever.

	- Session duration (in days): This setting determines how long (in days) a user's session will last before it expires, forcing the user to re-log in with their existing username and password.

	- Session inactivity time out: If Xaraya detects that a user's session has been idle for a certain period of time, it will expire the session. This setting determines how many minutes Xaraya will wait before expiring the session due to inactivity.

	Multi-language configuration
	----------------------------
	In this section of configuration, we configure multi-language support settings.
	- Mode: DDL
		- Single: The multi-language system uses only one charset, typically single byte but potentially multi-byte if 'mb_string' is built in. Information is stored coherently with the charset chosen at installation time.
		
		- Boxed: The multi-language system uses more than one charset (same consideration for the single or multi-byte matter as in Single), but only one charset per page is used (this should be an obvious concept, but it is important to understand). Content is not sharable between different language areas (for example an Arabic comment will not be shown in the English area even if refereed to the same object, say an article available in both English and Arabic). Another point is that every operation involves only a single language. This mode can produce unexpected results if 'mb_string' is not installed.
		
		- Unboxed: The multi-language system uses a universal charset to represent everything (read it as UTF-8). This guarantees that no conversion is needed between languages. Every page is always shown according to the user chosen language, but the page may contain text in other languages (for example a French article and comments inside an English page). You cannot use the UNBOXED mode of the multi-language system unless you have PHP 4.3.0 with the mbstring extension compiled in.

	- Default locale: From this drop-down list, select the default locale/language for your site. This setting defines the default language of the site. Unless support for additional languages is installed, the drop-down list will contain only one item. Support for additional languages is available from http://www.xaraya.com.

	- Available locales (comma-delimited): This field indicates which locales/languages are available for users on the site. For example, if you're testing a new locale (Klingon) you may not want users to see that Klingon is an option in the list of available locales until you are ready. When Klingon is added to this field, it is displayed as a choice for users. Separate entries in this field with a comma.

	- Translations backed: A backend is an entity capable of managing string-based and key-based translations. DDL
		- XML: Use XML for management of translations.

		- PHP: Use PHP for management of translations (default).

	Legacy Configuration
	--------------------
	- Load legacy support: Load Legacy allows the use of pnHTML and other legacy PostNuke functions. Xaraya itself is completely legacy free, but other modules may still yet use these functions. CHECK this box if your site will use any PostNuke functions. UNCHECK this box if you don't run any PostNuke functions to reduce the system load and improve performance.
	
	- Click "Update Base Configuration" to save changes.

- Bbclick Module: TRANSFORM. Make clickable hooks out of text. No administration panel.
Automatically transforms URLs entered into text fields into clickable links.

- Bbcode Module: TRANSFORM. Enables BBCode formatting. No administration panel.
Enables BBCode formatting markup tags in text fields on the site. When BBCode is activated for a module, that module will allow entry & display of BBCode tags. BBCode is a markup language that allows, among other options, making text bold by enclosing it in "[b]" and "[/b]" markups (for example, "[b]Bold Text[/b]").

When this module has been hooked to another module (for example, if you enable BBCode in Articles), an editor page will display BBCode formatting quick-buttons. If text in a text field is highlighted, it can be transformed by clicking one of the BBCode quick-buttons. For example, if text was highlighted in a text area and the "I" (italics) BBCode quick-button was clicked, the italics tags would be added before and after the highlighted text.

EXAMPLE: Adding BBCode / BBClick to a Publication Type
------------------------------------------------------
To add BBCode formatting capability or BBClick transformation to a Publication Type, follow these steps:
	- Go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks.

	- Click BBCode to select it as the module providing extra functionality. The panel will refresh, and you will see a list of modules to which the BBCode module can be hooked.

	- CHECK the module(s) in which you would like to enable BBCode formatting. For our example, CHECK "all articles" and "comments". Click "Save Changes" to save changes.

Go to Admin->Articles->Add Article. Click the "News Articles" Publication Type. On the resulting panel, the BBCode Form Controls are displayed above the Category selector box. Using these controls, or by manually entering BBCode formatting markup, BBCode can be used in articles.

To add BBClick capability, just go through the steps again substituting BBClick for BBCode.

- Bkview Module: BitKeeper repository viewer. Admin->Bkview.
This module permits viewing of a BitKeeper repository. If you use BitKeeper, this module will be useful for viewing items. If you do not use BitKeeper, this module will be of little use.
	- View repositories:

	- Add repository:
		- Repository name: Enter the name of the repository as you want it displayed on the site.

		- Path: Enter the complete path to the BitKeeper repository.

		- Click "Add repository" to save changes.

- Blocks Module: Administration of block instances and groups. Admin->Blocks.
Within Xaraya, Blocks act as building blocks to construct your site. Blocks are provided by the core Xaraya engine, or virtually 'bolted on' by modules. Core Xaraya blocks provide basic system functionality such as menus, while modules provide enhanced functionality or additional features. Using Blocks, the Administrator can customize the look of the site by adding, removing, or changing the position of Blocks.

Go to Admin->Blocks and use the sub-functions to add, edit, view, or delete Blocks from your website. The Blocks display is sorted by Group.

				- Meta description: Enter a description of your site in this field. The contents of this field are sent as a metadata "Description" for the site.

				- Meta keywords: One of the challenges when running a web site is letting external search engines know that your site exists. Meta keywords categorize your site. Many search engines send out robots (also called 'spiders') to search the Web for content. When you define Meta Keywords for your site though this configuration option, you make it easier for the search-engine robots to categorize your site, and your site will be categorized more appropriately since you are defining the options. Enter words & phrases, separated by commas, that describe the focus of your web site. Capitalization is not important in this field. Many search engines limit the number of keywords that you can use. Therefore, you should choose your words carefully and use no more than 10-15 keywords that best describe your site's content. 

				If your site is all about rock and roll music, for example, you might enter the following information in this field: "music, rock, roll, beatles, aerosmith, guitar, drum, bass, sing, singer, singing" 

				For additional information on Meta Keywords, please visit Web Developer-META Tag Resources (http://www.webdeveloper.com/html/html_metatag_res.html) or The META Tag Builder (http://vancouver-webpages.com/META). 

				- Use GeoURL (http://www.geourl.org): GeoURL is a location-to-URL reverse directory. This will allow you to find URLs by their proximity to a given location. Find your neighbor's blog, perhaps, or the web page of the restaurants near you. GeoURL's page provides tools for determining your location's latitude and longitude.
					- Your Longitude: In this field, enter your longitude in the format "W 84.520407".

					- Your Latitude: In this field, enter your latitude in the format "N 39.283899".

				- Use Dyanamic Keywords: In addition to defining your own keywords for your site (in Meta keywords, above), you can choose to have meta keywords generated dynamically. When this option is CHECKED, meta keywords are generated dynamically whenever the full text of an article is displayed. All the words in the article are used as meta keywords. CHECKING this function has a small performance cost.

EXAMPLE: Adding, modifying, and deleting block instances
--------------------------------------------------------
Adding block instances
----------------------
For these examples, we'll add a few block instances to work with. Following the instructions in Admin->Blocks->Add Instance (above), add the following three blocks:
	- Block #1:
		- Title: Base HTML Block 1

		- Type: Base \ HTML

		- Group: Center

		- Leave the other items set at their default.

		- Click "Create Instance" to save changes.

		- In the HTML field that appears in the next panel, type:
			"<b>This is BASE HTML BLOCK # 1.</b>" (no quotes)

		- Click "Update" to save changes.

	- Block #2:
		- Do the same steps as with Block #1, substituting "Base HTML Block 2" for the title and "<b>This is BASE HTML BLOCK # 2.</b>" for the HTML field.

	- Block #3:
		- Do the same steps as with Block #1, substituting "Base HTML Block 3" for the title and "<b>This is BASE HTML BLOCK # 3.</b>" for the HTML field.

If you go to the front page of the site (click the Xaraya logo in the top left corner of the default theme), you'll see these three blocks displayed in ascending numerical order.

Modifying block instances
-------------------------
If you wish to modify a block instance, go to Admin->Blocks->View Instances. Click "Edit" on the line next to the block instance you wish to modify. On the next panel, make your changes and click the "Update" button to save changes.
	- For our example, edit Block #2's title to read "The Second Base HTML Block" and the HTML to read "Here's the second HTML block". Be sure to "Update" to save your changes.

Deleting block instances
------------------------
To delete a block instance, go to Admin->Blocks->View Instances. Click "Delete" on the line next to the block instance you wish to delete. On the next panel, confirm your intention to delete.

EXAMPLE: Changing the order of blocks within Groups
---------------------------------------------------
Follow this example, using the three blocks we added in "Adding block instances", above, to learn how to change the order of block instances within Groups,
	- If you don't have the three sample block instances from "Adding block instances", above, create them now.
	
	- Go to Admin->Blocks->View Groups. Click "Edit" on the line next to the block group you wish to modify. In this example, click "Edit" on the line next to the "Center" block group. On the next panel, modify the order of block instances. Left-click on an instance to select it, then use the UP and DOWN arrow icons to change the placement of the selected block instance in the block group. Click the "Update" button to save changes.
		- For our example, move the block instances we created into the following orders, saving changes between each:
			- 3, 2, 1

			- 1, 3, 2

			- 2, 1, 3

	- When you have finished this example, delete the three block instances. Follow instructions in 'Deleting block instances', above.

- Comments Module: Allows users to post comments in any module that uses hooks. Admin->Comments.
	- Overview: Displays the overview panel for this module. This panel contains information about the module and how to use it.

	- View Statistics:
	This panel displays statistics about all comments on the site. From this panel the administrator can see the total number of comments and where the comments are located. Additional actions allow deletion of comments, either selective or complete.
		- Module name: The name of the module containing comments. Click the module name to go to that module's statistics panel containing figures for each of that module's pages that have comments associated with them. From that panel, you can delete all comments associated with a particular page.

	- Modify config:
	This panel allows modification of configuration options for this module.
		- Default rendering depth:
			- 1...9: From this drop-down list, select the default rendering depth for comments on the site. This setting determines how many levels of comments are displayed. For example, if you set it to "2", Xaraya will show the top 2 levels of comments and a setting of "9" will show up to 9 levels of nested comments. It is unlikely that you'll experience 9 nested levels of comments. An example of 9 nested comments is a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply!
			
			If a message's comments go beyond the default rendering depth, a message is displayed notifying the user that the particular message has additional comments that are not displayed, and that the user can click the message to display all the comments. Suggested setting is "9".

		- Default rendering style:
			- Nested: Comments are displayed with child comments 'nested' (indented slightly) underneath their parent comments. This is a recommended setting, as it is easy to visually track comments and sub-comments. Comments are displayed expanded.

			- Flat: Comments are displayed with child comments in the same level (no indentation) as their parents. Comments are displayed expanded.

			- Threaded: Threaded view displays comments in a tree-like structure with the parent comment at the top with child comments below. The threaded view is similar to the default view in many mail readers, along with cute threaded images. Comments are displayed collapsed.

			- No comments: Do not display comments. If a user turns off comments while reading comments (not in user preferences but on an actual page with comments) the only way to turn them back on at the moment is by going to user preferences.

		- Default sorting mode:
		Defines the default sorting mode for comments. Registered users can change their sort order if they wish. Default sorting mode relies on Default sorting order, below, to determine if the items are displayed in ascending or descending order.
			- Author: Sort comments by the author's username.

			- Date: Sort comments by the date/time of the comment.

			- Thread: Sort comments into threads.

			- Title: Sort comments by the title of the comment.

		- Default sorting order:

Click "Edit" to edit the Ephemerid to your satisfaction, and then click "Submit" to save. To delete an Ephemerid, click "Delete" and confirm your intention by clicking "Submit".

Click Admin->Ephemerids->Modify config to modify the number of ephemerids displayed per page in Administration. Click "Update Ephemerids Configuration" to save changes.

EXAMPLE: Adding an Ephemerids block
-----------------------------------
In this example, we'll add an Ephemerid block to the front page of the site. The process for adding an Ephemerid block is the same as adding any other block instance. If you're comfortable with adding block instances, you can skip this example.

First we must make sure that Ephemerids are installed & stocked with data. Install the Ephemerid module if necessary. Go to Admin->Ephemerids->Add and add a few ephemerids. In order to see the results of your work, enter at least one ephemerid with today's date.

Next, go to Admin->Blocks->Add Instance. Enter the title of your new block ("Today in history..."), select "ephemerids \ ephem" from the Type drop-down list, select the Group for the block (right), and click "Create Instance". To check that your new block instance has been created, go to Admin->Blocks->View Instances. You will see "Today in history..." (or whatever you called your block) listed. To view the Ephemerid, go to the front page of the site. You'll see the ephemerid block displayed there!

RSS is a Web content syndication format. Using RSS, your site can 'pull' content in the form of headlines from selected websites and display that content on your site. If a user of your site is interested in reading the article, they can click a link to be taken to the other site. The Headlines modules facilitates this process.

Your site can be syndicated assuming that you have configured Admin->Bloggerapi. The link for syndication of your site is "www.yoursite.com/index.php?module=articles&func=view&theme=rss".
	- Add:
	In this section of the Headlines module, we specify the news feeds that we want to syndicate.
		- List of available feeds: Click this link to open a new browser window with http://www.syndic8.com. Click "Feeds" at the top of the Syndic8 site to display a list of available feeds, or enter search criteria and search for feeds. Once you have found a feed you wish to syndicate, copy the Feed URL from Syndic8 into the URL field, below.

		- URL: Once you know the URL for the news feed you wish to syndicate, enter the complete URL (including "http://")in this space and click "Create Headline" to save changes. The news feed is added to the site's Headlines list.

From 0 to 999, you may assign an order number to your news feeds to arrange them in your preferred order. These numbers do not need to be consecutive; it is perfectly acceptable to number your news feeds by 5's or 10's as you see fit. If you do not assign order numbers, sites are displayed in the order in which they were added.

		- Options:
			- Edit: Permits modification of a news feed.
				- URL: Enter the complete URL (including "http://") for the news feed.

EXAMPLE: Adding Image Uploads to a Publication Type
---------------------------------------------------
To allow users to upload images to the site and include the uploaded images in articles, we must complete several steps. These steps are listed below.
	- Create a directory where uploaded images will be stored. Default is "<xarroot>/var/uploads", but the directory can be anywhere you'd like.

	- Change the permissions on the UPLOAD directory to world-readable & world-writable. On Linux systems, this is done by "chmod 777 <path_to_upload_dir>".

	- Install the Uploads module. Go to Admin->Modules->View All. Click "Regenerate" and click the "Reload" button to refresh the page. Click "Install" next to the Uploads module if necessary.

	- Admin->Uploads->Modify Config.
		- In the "Uploads Directory" field, enter the full path to the uploaded images folder on your server, including ending slash.
		
		- Ensure that you're satisfied with the permitted extensions in the Allowed File Extensions field. For example, "gif;jpg;png;zip;tar.gz;tgz".
		
		- Edit the other settings in this panel to your preferences.

		- Click "Submit Query" to save changes.

	- We want to enable Uploads in Articles Publication Type, so we must hook the Uploads module to the Publication Type(s) of the Articles module. Go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Select the Publication Type to which you would like to hook Uploads and click "Article Config" next to it.
		- If you do not see "Dynamic Data Fields [modify]" at the bottom of the panel, you need to enable Dynamic Data for the Articles module before you can continue. To enable Dynamic Data for the Articles module, do the following:
			- Admin->Modules->View All. Locate the Articles module in the panel. Click "On/Off" under Hooks next to the Articles module.

			- On the panel that appears, place a CHECK in the box next to Uploads to enable Uploads in Articles. You can select either ALL Publication Types in Articles (by CHECKING the "All" column) or select specific Publication Type(s) by CHECKing their individual boxes.

			- Click "Save Changes" to save changes.
			
			- Go back to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Select the Publication Type to which you would like to hook Uploads and click "Article Config" next to it.
			
		- If you see "Dynamic Data Fields [modify]" at the bottom of the panel, click "[modify]". A new browser window will open. In this new window we define the Dynamic Data field that will hold the uploaded image filename.
			- Enter text to be displayed to the user in the "Label" field. For example, "Image".

			- From the Property Type drop-down list, select "File Upload".
			
			- The remaining fields should be set as follows:
				- Default is blank.

				- Data source is set to "dynamic_data".

				- Validation is blank.

				- Status is Active.

			- Click "Update Properties" to save changes. The new Dynamic Data field is added to the Publication Type.

- Xmlrpcserver Module: Base XML-RPC server, support for multiple APIs through other modules. No administration panel.

- Xmlrpcsystemapi Module: System API for XML-RPC server, implements the system.* methods. Admin->Xmlrpcsystemapi.
The XML-RPC system API implements the reserved methods for a XML-RPC server. These methods are always named "system.something" and are assumed to be reserved names. This means that other APIs cannot use the "system" prefix for their registered methods.

In Xaraya the webservices module is responsible for providing the xmlrpc transport needed for this API functionality.

You can find the specification for the system API at: http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/introspection.html

- Xmlrpcvalidatorapi Module: Validation API for XML-RPC server. Admin->Xmlrpcvalidatorapi.
The XML-RPC validator API is an XML-RPC API used to validate a XML-RPC installation on conformance to the specification. It implements the necessary methods on the server so test clients can validate whether the server conforms to the specification.

In Xaraya the webservices module is responsible for providing the xmlrpc transport needed for this API functionality.

You can find a validation service at http://validator.xmlrpc.com. You can use this to validate whether the Xaraya XML-RPC server conforms to the standard.

If Xaraya returns an error when you attempt to install this module, you may not have the necessary PHP extension installed. Refer to http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.xslt.php for instructions on how to install the necessary extensions.

KNOWLEDGE REVIEW: Manipulating Modules (Adding and Removing Modules)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easy to add or remove modules at any time after Xaraya installation.
- Adding a new module:
To add a new module to Xaraya, follow these steps:
	- Download the new module.

	- Un-archive the new module into a temporary directory (if necessary).

	- Configure the module (read the module's documentation to determine what pre-installation configuration, if any, is necessary).

	- Copy (or upload) the module directory & sub-directory from the temporary directory to <xarroot>/modules.

	- Assign appropriate ownership and permissions (if necessary).

	- As the site administrator, go to Admin->Modules->View All. CHECK the Regenerate box at the top right of the panel and click the "Reload" button. Xaraya will scan the <xarroot>/modules directory and display all modules that are available, including the new module.

	- Click "Install" on the line next to the new module you wish to install. The module will be installed.

	- Perform any post-installation configuration of the module (if necessary). If a module has post-installation configuration options available, you can click on the module name in Admin->Modules->View All to go to the module's configuration panel. You may also click on the module name in the Admin menu on the left of the browser window.

- Removing a module:
To remove a module from Xaraya, follow these steps:
	- Identify the module you wish to remove.

	- As the site administrator, go to Admin->Modules->View All.

	- If the module is active, click "Deactivate" on the line with the module to be removed. When a  module has been deactivated, it is no longer available to users but no module data is removed. If you intend to make the module active again in the future but do not want the module to be available to users at the moment, it is advised to leave the module in a deactivated state.

	- To completely remove the module's data, click "Remove". The module's data is removed from the database (including configuration settings and stored information). Once a module has been "Removed", it is necessary to re-install and re-configure the module if you intend to use it again.

	- If you wish to remove the module completely from your Xaraya site, delete the module's directory from <xarroot>/modules. Consult your webserver's operating system documentation for how to accomplish this.

HOOKS
=====
An Introduction to Hooks
------------------------
Hooks extend the functionality of modules by allowing site resources to be re-used in a variety of ways across the site. Hooks increase the interoperability and efficiency of Xaraya. For example, a site resource is BBCODE (which allows bbcode-style formatting to be used in text entry). Rather than code BBCODE for articles and re-code it again for comments, we can simply "hook" BBCODE functionality into the articles and comments modules, and any other modules we wish.

Xaraya provides two different methods to view or edit hooks.

	* Admin->Modules->View All: Click "On/Off" under the Hooks heading for the module to view or edit hooks that are enabled for the particular module. So, for example, if you wanted to view the active hooks for the Articles module, click "On/Off" under the Hooks heading for the Articles module. You see the modules that are 'hooked' into this module, and can add or remove hooks. Be sure to click "Save Changes" to save changes.

	* Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks: The simplest way to determine the order in which to click items to activate hooks is to fill in the blanks of this sentence: "I want to enable ____ in ____." So, for example, if you wanted to enable comments in articles, you would first click comments, then CHECK articles. Be sure to click "Save Changes" to save changes.
	
Each of these two methods serve the same purpose -- to display hooked modules and allow modification of hooks. Work with each of them to determine which of the methods suits you best.

	- Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks:
	Using 'hooks' in Xaraya, you can extend the functionality of your modules.

	Select the hook module providing the extra functionality and then check the boxes of the modules in which you would like to enable that functionality (For example, select "Comments" and then check "Articles" to enable Comments within the Articles module.)
		- Autolinks:
			CHECK Articles to active Autolinks for ALL Publication Types under Articles.
				- or -
				Check the Article Types for which you'd like Autolinks to be activated, for example:
					- CHECK News Articles

					- CHECK Reviews

					- CHECK FAQs

					- Check any additional Article Types as you wish.

			CHECK Comments

			CHECK Wiki

			Click "Save Changes" to save changes.

		- COMMENTS:
			CHECK Articles
				Check the Article Types for which you'd like Autolinks to be activated, for example:
					- CHECK News Articles

					- CHECK Reviews

					- CHECK FAQs

					- Check any additional Article Types as you wish.

			Click "Save Changes" to save changes.

PUBLICATION TYPES
=================
Introduction to Publication Types
---------------------------------
Xaraya's Articles module can manage 'articles' of different types at the same time, for instance news articles, longer documents in different sections, frequently asked questions, and so on.

These types are called 'Publication Types', and each type of article can utilize a different set of data fields, with a different meaning for each data field. For example, the 'summary' field could be used for an Introduction in News articles, for providing some Details about a question in FAQs, or not be used at all for Section documents.

There is a specific menu for management of Publication Types which allows you to change the description that appears in navigation menus, enable & disable dynamic data fields, or change their meaning for a particular type, or create or delete publication types according to your needs.

Each publication type also has its own templates, so that the look & feel of each publication type can be customized. Until you define templates for the new publication type, Xaraya will display items using default templates (and a warning).

A default set of publication types and templates (corresponding to the old News, Sections and FAQs modules of PostNuke or PHP-Nuke) is included as part of the installation.

Want to display recipes on your site? Create a new Publication Type, and Xaraya can do that.

A good strategy for configuration of Categories is to create a top-level Category called <sitename>, and below that group all the sub-categories for the site. This "<sitename>" top-level category could be considered to be the ROOT CATEGORY, with additional Categories placed below the ROOT CATEGORY. For example, if the site is "MySite.COM":
	MySite.COM (root category)
	|
	|---World News (sub-category)
	|   |
	|   |---North American News (sub-sub-category)
	|   |   |
	|   |   |---United States News (sub-sub-sub-category)
	|   |       |
	|   |       |---Ohio News (sub-sub-sub-sub-category)
	|   |       |
	|   |       |---Nevada News (sub-sub-sub-sub-category)
	|   |       |
	|   |       |---etc...
	|   |
	|   |---Asian News (sub-sub-category)
	|       |
	|       |---China News (sub-sub-sub-category)
	|       |
	|       |---Japan News (sub-sub-sub-category)
	|       |
	|       |---etc...
	|
	|---Sports News (sub-category)
	|
	|---Music News (sub-category)
	|
	|---Entertainment News (sub-category)
	|
	|---etc...

PUBLICATION TYPES CAN BE USED ONLY BY ARTICLES. CATEGORIES CAN BE USED BY ALL MODULES. A module that cannot fit into a Publication Type can still use Categories if they want. Plus 'Site News' could be a Category; you can put news articles in there... But you might ALSO have a 'Software News' Category.

Admin->Content->Articles->Publication Types:
	- New: Add a new Publication Type
	NOTE: Articles of this Publication Type will use the templates "user-display-[publicationtype].xd" and "user-summary-[publicationtype].xd" by default. Provide those templates before adding new articles.

EXAMPLE: New Publication Type: A Blogger
----------------------------------------
	WHAT IS A BLOG? WHAT IS BLOGGING?:
	----------------------------------
	blog n.: [common] Short for "weblog", an on-line web-zine or diary (usually with facilities for reader comments and discussion threads) made accessible through the World Wide Web. The term "blog" is widespread and readily forms derivatives, of which the best known may be "blogosphere" (the hyperlinked totality of all blogs and the culture surrounding blogs).

	There are tens of thousands of weblogs ("Blogs") on the Net, many of them updated daily -- some of them many times a day. Some Blogs are public diaries while others are the authoritative or idiosyncratic musings of experts and cranks.

	"Blogging" is the process of turning one's own filter on news and the world into something others might want to read, link to, and write about themselves.

	Blogging is facilitated by desktop BlogTools -- word-processor-like tools that are created to encourage frequent updates of a blog by providing an easy interface, specialized tools, and a moment's readiness -- without the need to open your browser.

	FILES INCLUDED WITH THIS TUTORIAL:
	----------------------------------
	The following files are included with this tutorial. OTTO: Move to FILES INCLUDED WITH THIS GUIDE, above, when complete.
		-

	ACTIVATING NECESSARY MODULES FOR BLOGGING:
	------------------------------------------
	In order to configure our Xaraya site for blogging, it is necessary to ensure that certain modules are activated. We need to activate at least three (and, optionally, a fourth) modules:
		- articles -- storage of the blog entries

		- bloggerapi -- the central axis for blogging in Xaraya

		- categories -- categorization of blogs

		- comments (optional) -- provides the ability to comment on blog entries

	To activate the modules, log in as Administrator and go to Admin->Modules->View All. Some of the modules listed above may already be active on your site. If the modules listed above are not shown with a Status of "Active", they each need to be installed by clicking "Install" on their line.

	Once you have ensured that the modules listed above are Active on your site, we can move forward to the next step.

	CREATING A PUBLICATION TYPE FOR THE BLOG:
	-----------------------------------------
	While not required, it is recommended that you create a specific Publication Type for your blog in articles configuration. Doing so allows us to use the site first for blogging only and offers the flexibility of adding additonal types of content later on. If you do not wish to create a specific Publication Type for your blog, simply use one of the existing Publication Types -- for example, "news".
	
	Go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Click "New" to begin adding a new Publication Type with the following values:
	
	<center><img src="images/blogger/PubType.jpg"></center>
	
	Click "Create" to save changes.
	
	ADD CATEGORIES TO THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE:
	-------------------------------------------
	Go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Click "Article Config" on the 'blog' line. At the bottom of the panel, change Number of possible categories to 1. Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.
	
	When the panel refreshes, select a category for blog entries from the 'Base category for articles' drop-down list. Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.
	
	ACTIVATING HOOKS:
	-----------------
	Go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks. Click on 'categories', then CHECK 'blog'. You could CHECK 'all articles' instead of 'blog' if you want categories to be enabled for every article Publication Type. For the purpose of this tutorial, it doesn't matter which of the two options you choose. Click "Save Changes" to save changes.
	
	LINK BLOGGERAPI TO THE BLOG PUBLICATION TYPE:
	---------------------------------------------
	This step connects the incoming data from your BlogTool to the correct Publication Type in Xaraya.
	
	Click Admin->Bloggerapi->Modify config. On the panel that appears, select the Publication Type to which you would like to point your Blog entries. Select 'blog : Weblog on this site', which is the Publication Type we created in CREATING A PUBLICATION TYPE FOR THE BLOG, above, and click "Update bloggerapi Configuration" to save changes.
	
	We're now done with the Xaraya-side configuration of your blog. Let's move to the BlogTool configuration.
	
	CONFIGURING YOUR BLOGTOOL:
	--------------------------
	For Windows we recommend w.bloggar. For other operating systems, MozBlog is the recommended tool.
	
	Configuring w.bloggar -- http://www.wbloggar.com:
		Download the latest version of w.bloggar from the site above. Install it on any computer(s) from which you'd like to be able to update your Xaraya site.
		
		Start w.bloggar. A small account manager window will open for you to configure the site to which you wish to send the blog entries.
	
		Account: <<New>>
	
		User: Enter the user name of a user on your Xaraya site. Any blog entries made through this BlogTool will be posted as this user.
	
		Password: Enter the corresponding password for the user above.
		
		Click "Okay". You will be asked if you want to create this new account. Click "Yes" and you're taken to the Account Properties screen.
			- Blog Tool: >>Custom<<
	
			- Account Alias: The display name for this account, shown in the drop-down account selection list of this BlogTool. "Xaraya weblog" is a good choice, but you can enter whatever you want here.
	
			- Ping Weblogs.com: If you would like a notification sent to weblogs.com each time you use this BlogTool to update your site, check this box.

EXAMPLE: New Publication Type: A Recipe Category for Xaraya
-----------------------------------------------------------
This advanced example shows how to create a new Publication Type (Recipes) using Dynamic Data in Xaraya. We cover Dynamic Data in depth later in this Guide.

	1. LOG IN AS A XARAYA ADMINISTRATOR: This is done any time you wish to have Administrator access to your Xaraya site.

	2. CREATE A NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.

	To create the new Publication Type, go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Click "New". Complete the fields as follows:
	
		Type: recipes (NOTE: Lower case.)
		Description: Recipe Collection
	
		Field: title
		Label: Recipe Title
		Format: Text Box
		Input: CHECKED
	
		Field: summary
		Label: Description
		Format: Small Text Area
		Input: CHECKED
	
		Field: bodytext
		Label: Ingredients
		Format: Large Text Area
		Input: CHECKED
	
		Field: bodyfile
		Label: (this field should be blank)
		Format: (as long as Label, above, is blank and Input, below is UNCHECKED, it does not matter what this field contains)
		Input: UNCHECKED
	
		Field: notes
		Label: Instructions
		Format: Large Text Area
		Input: CHECKED
	
	Do not modify the last 3 fields (authorid, pubdate, and status); leave them as they are.
	
	Click "Create" to save changes.
	
	3. ENABLE DYNAMIC DATA FOR ARTICLES/RECIPES: This is done for each custom Publication Type using Dynamic Data you create, unless Dynamic Data has previously been enabled for the module.
	
	To enable Dynamic Data for a Publiction Type, go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks. We want to enable Dynamic Data within Articles, so click "dynamicdata" and CHECK the box for Articles and the 'Recipe Collection' sub-category under Articles. Click "Save Changes".
	
	4. ADD DYNAMIC DATA FIELD(S) TO THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type using Dynamic Data you create.
	
	To add dynamic data field(s) to the new publication type, go to Admin->Articles->Publication Types. Find the 'recipes' Publication Type that we created in CREATE A NEW PUBLICATION TYPE, above, and click Article Config next to it. Near the bottom of the next screen, you'll see "Dynamic Data Fields [modify]". Click "[modify]" and in the new window that opens, enter the Dynamic Data as follows:
	
		Label: photo (NOTE: Lower case.)

		Property Type: Image

		Data Source: dynamic_data

		Status: Active
	
	Click "Update Properties" to save changes. Close the window and return to the previous browser window for the rest of the steps.
	
	5. ADD A NEW CATEGORY (AND OPTIONAL SUB-CATEGORIES) FOR THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.
	
	To add the new cateory (and optional sub-categories), go to Admin->Categories. Click "Add Category" to add a new Category. For this example:
	
	Create a new Category called "Recipes Category" by following the steps below:
		- Name: Recipes Category

		- Description: This is the recipes category for this site.

		- In relation to this category: Generic1

		- Position: Right before, in the same level

		- Optional image: categoryrecipes_top.jpg

		- Click "Add" to add the new category.
	
	Create three sub-categories: "Appetizers & Soups", "Breads & Baked Goods", and finally "Desserts". To create the "Appetizers & Soups" sub-category, click "Add Category" and follow these steps:
		- Name: Appetizers & Soups

		- Description: Soups and Appetizer recipes go here.

		- In relation to this category: Recipes Category

		- Position: The first child category

		- Optional image: categorysoups.jpg

		- Click "Add" to add the new category.
	
	To create the next two sub-categories, click "Add Category" and follow these steps:
		- Name: Breads & Baked Goods

		- Description: Breads & baked goods recipes go here.

		- In relation to this category: Recipes Category / Appetizers & Soups

		- Position: Right after, in the same level

		- Optional image: categorybaked.jpg

		- Click "Add" to add the new category.
	
	Create another sub-category, typing "Desserts" in the Name field, "Dessert recipes go here" for the Description, and "categorydesserts.jpg" as the image.
	
	6. ADD THE NEW PUBLICTION TYPE TO A CATAGORY: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.
	
	To add Publication Types to Categories, go to Admin->Articles->Modify config and click on the description of the Publication Type we created (in this example, it's "Recipe Collection"). Scroll down, and you'll see:
	
		Number of possible categories: 0
		
		Change the "0" to "1".
		
		Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.
		
	After the screen refreshes, scroll to the bottom of the center section and select the Category for the new Publication Type. In this example, if it's not already selected, select "Recipes Category" that we created above. Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.
	
	7. CONFIGURE THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.
	
	Still in Admin->Articles->Modify config, click on the description of the publication type we just created (in this example, it's "Recipe Collection"). Make the following changes:
	
		Use 'recipes' as alias in short URLs: CHECKED

		Default start view: Browse in Recipes Category

		Number of columns ($numcols): 1

		Items per page ($number): 10

		Show category links in article summaries ($categories): CHECKED

		Show previous/next category ($showprevnext): CHECKED

		Show number of comments ($comments): CHECKED

		Show hit counts ($counter): CHECKED

		Show ratings ($rating): CHECKED

		Show links to publication types ($showpublinks + includes/publinks.xd): CHECKED

		Show link to archives ($archivelink + $archivelabel): CHECKED

		Show link to article map ($maplink + $maplabel): CHECKED

		Call transform hooks in summaries: UNCHECKED

		Show link to previous/next article in display ($prevart + $nextart): CHECKED
		
		NOTE: Items enclosed in parenthesis above are the names of the variables used in templates.
	
		Click "Update Configuration" to save changes.
	
	8. ADD TEMPLATES FOR THE NEW PUBLICTION TYPE: This can be done for each custom Publication Type you create.
	
	We can create up to three custom display templates to tell Xaraya specifically how to display this new Publication Type. Example files are included in this tutorial distribution. If you do not create a template, Xaraya will attempt to display the Publication Type using a default template.
	
	Template files are placed into the <xarroot>/modules/articles/xartemplates directory, and should be called 'user-display-<pubtype>.xd', 'user-summary-<pubtype>.xd', and  (optionally) 'user-view-<pubtype>.xd', where <pubtype> is the name of the Publication Type (in this tutorial, <pubtype> is "recipes" as created in step #2 above):
	
		user-display-recipes.xd -- this is the main view of the data

		user-summary-recpies.xd -- this is a summary view of the data

		user-view-recipes.xd (optional)
	
	If you wish to create theme-specific versions of these files, rename the files from *.xd to *.xt and place the theme-specific version in the <xarroot>/themes/<theme_name>/modules/articles directory, creating directories as necessary.
	
	It is recommended that you begin by examining the example files included with this tutorial, or open one of the sample templates provided with Xaraya and make changes as necessary using your favorite HTML editor. Where ever you want to display the fields in the new Publication Type, enter "#$fieldname#" (no quotes) in the template. Xaraya will replace "#$fieldname#" with the contents of the field as stored in the database. In this tutorial, we created the following fields, which are available for display in the template using the #$fieldname# indicated in parenthesis:
		- title (#$title#)

		- summary (#$summary#)

		- bodytext (#$bodytext#)

		- notes (#$notes#)

		- photo (#$photo#)
	
	The templates included with this tutorial distribution expect to find a file called "NoPhoto.gif" in the <xarroot>/images/recipes/ directory of your website. This file is displayed if a Photograph URL is not provided in the article submission, and is included with this tutorial distribution. Copy NoPhoto.gif to the <xarroot>/images/recipes/ directory, creating directories as necessary.
	
	9. ADD AN ARTICLE TO THE NEW PUBLICATION TYPE: This is done for each custom Publication Type you create.
	
	Now articles can be added to the new publication type. Click Admin->Articles->Add Article and click on the name of the new Publication Type (in this example, it's Recipe Collection). A sample recipe is included with this tutorial (SampleRecipe.txt).
	
	Enter the Recipe Title, Description, Ingredients, Directions, and a URL for the photograph for the recipe. Select the appropriate Category for the recipe, and click "Preview" to see what the recipe will look like, or click "Add Article" to save it.
	
	On the following panel, approve the article by putting a CHECK in the STATUS box, and selecting "Approved" from the drop-down list at the bottom of the panel. Click "Change Status" to save changes.
	
	10. LOGOUT FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT
	It is a wise idea, though technically not required, to log out of your administrator account at the end of each session. To log out of your Xaraya administrator account, click [admin logout], which appears at the bottom of the Administration menu. Confirm your intention to log out by clicking "Logout", or click "Cancel" to abort the logout.

DYNAMIC DATA
============
Introduction to Dynamic Data
----------------------------
With other CMS products, if, for example, you wanted to display Recipes on your site, you had to wait for a Recipes module to be developed. Xaraya is a Content Management System that is capable of showing almost any data in almost any way that you desire. No more waiting for someone else to modify the guestbook, no more waiting for someone else to develop a recipe module, no more waiting for someone to add categories to the reviews module, no more waiting for a module to display user portraits or additional user information. Xaraya gives the site administrator the power to be self-sufficient and the flexibility to extend Xaraya without coding.

Dynamic Data allows Xaraya's site administrators to customize Xaraya specifically for their needs.

Using Dynamic Data, site administrators can add fields to Xaraya that customize the site.

Here's a general overview illustrating how to add dynamic data to a Xaraya module:
	* Enable the Dynamic Data HOOK for the module you wish to extend

	* Create the Dynamic Data OBJECT

	OTTO: * Define how the Dynamic Data object is DISPLAYED

EXAMPLE: Dynamic Data: Adding a Picture to User Info
----------------------------------------------------
For a specific example, we'll add a picture to user's information on the site. The user's picture must be accessible via the web; this feature does not allow the uploading of picture. Let's walk through the steps to set this up...

* Enable the Dynamic Data HOOK for the module you wish to extend
The first thing to do is to enable the dynamic data hook for the module you wish to extend. For this example, we wish to extend the roles module. OTTO: How to determine WHICH module to enable DD for? To enable Dynamic Data for the roles module, follow these steps:
	- Go to Admin->Modules->Configure Hooks

	- Click "dynamicdata"

	- CHECK the box next to 'roles' to enable Dynamic Data for the roles module

	- Click "Save Changes"

* Create the Dynamic Data OBJECT
Now we need to create the dynamic data object that will hold the picture information for the roles module. To do this: 
	- Go to Admin->Dynamicdata->View Objects 

	- Under "Other Modules/Users & Groups", click on "View Properties" for the roles module

	- In Label, type "My Picture" (or whatever text you want displayed to your users)

	- In Property Type, select "Image" from the drop-down list.

	- In status select "Display Only". This will stop it showing in the membership list but will still make it visible in the user info.

	- Click "Update Properties" to save changes.

You are returned to a similar-looking screen with your new Dynamic Data object displayed. Your Dynamic Data object has been added.

* Adding a picture to your user info
You'll need a picture that is accessible via the web to add a picture to your user info. To add the picture, follow these steps:
	- As Administrator, go to Main Menu->Modules->Roles (NOTE: Do NOT click Admin->Roles for this option).

	- Click "Your Details".

	- Add the URL of your picture to the "My Picture" field. Be sure it begins with "http://" unless the picture is on your local webserver.

	- Click "Submit".

* Viewing the picture
There are two ways to do this. Once you've added your picture's URL click the "show" link next to it in "Your Basic Details", or click on the user's name in the membership list.

PRIVILEGES: BUILDING BLOCKS FOR SITE ACCESS
===========================================
Introduction to Privileges
--------------------------
Xaraya provides tools for very fine-grained access control for site users on either a Group or individual User level. Many of the concepts behind user roles and privileges are based in Object Oriented Programming.

Privileges are individual access rights (Example: Allow Comments on Articles. Example: Do not allow access to administration options.) that can be used as building blocks and collected together into Compound Priviliges.

Individual Privileges or Compound Privileges are placed into Roles on the site. Site Roles are built from specific Privileges or Compound Privileges. Privileges are made from Access Levels. Access Levels are the basis for the access control system in Xaraya. Users are placed into Roles and have permission to do whatever the Priviliges associated with that Role permit them to do on the site.

Terminology
-----------
Because Xaraya's Roles & Privileges are considerably different from user rights in other Content Management Systems, let's first define some terminology that will be used in this section of the Guide.
	- Role: A uniquely-named set of one or more users. A Role can correspond to a User or Group of users.

	- Privilege: An object that can grant or deny a particular kind of access to a module component. For example, the ability to view the Login Block is a privilege, the ability to edit an Article is a privilege, and the ability to post a comment is a privilege.

	- Module: A functional unit of a Xaraya site -- a module of the Xaraya system (articles, polls, messages, ratings, quotes, headlines, etc).

	- Component: A group of resources that can be protected with the security system. Components are defined by the modules in which they reside. Components can be VISUALLY DISCRETE resources, such as blocks or web pages, or they can be FUNCTIONALITY resources, such as the ability to add or edit items. Components can be defined in any way the module developer wishes, for example, "adding an article", "viewing a link", "displaying a menu", etc, could all be designed as components by the module author. Some components coincide with concepts known outside the security system, such as blocks, but this is not necessarily the case.

	- Instance: A specific instance of a component. For example, the login block on the front page of a Xaraya site is an instance of the Block component in the Roles module. Another example of a 'Component' and an 'Instance': the Component might be menus in a module while the Instance would be "menu number 7". Think of Components as classes of Privilege objects and Instances as specific examples of those objects.

	- Mask: A special kind of privilege used to check other privileges. Each mask protects one or more components. When a mask is encountered, it is checked against the user's privileges to see whether access to the component in question is permitted.

	- Access level: The type of access granted by a privilege or required by a mask. An access level is the right to access a resource. Security levels in Xaraya go from 0 (no access) to 800 (admin or full access).

	- Realms: Realms are a way of creating different security views of the same Xaraya site. They are an "extra dimension" used to make finely-grained security schemes.

EXAMPLE: If you would like anonymous users to be able to view items on your website (but be unable to post comments), add the following privilege:

- Admin->Privileges->Add Privilege:
	- Click "with rights" radio button -- the panel will reload with additional options

	- Name: ViewTopics

	- Member of: CasualAccess (If you DO NOT select an existing privilege of which the new privilege is a member, the new privilege will appear in the top level. If you select a Member from the DDL, the priv appears in TWO places... 1. Top level, 2. under the Priv I selected from the DDL. This is so the privilege is re-usable. It also prevents the priv from being "lost".)

	- Realm: All

	- Module: Articles

	- Component: All

	- Level: Set to "Read"

	- Click "Add"

Explanation of privilege levels: OTTO verify with John Cox or Dracos
--------------------------------
	- None: User has no access to this item.

	- Overview: User can see the SUMMARY of an article, or be shown a link but not the link itself.

	- Read: User has READ ONLY access to this item.

	- Comment: User can POST COMMENTS about this item.

	- Moderate: Used for functions that require moderation, such as Comments, or in Forums. An example is a user having moderation abilities within a message board but nowhere else on the site.

	- Edit: "Edit" is a permission for users that may not be permitted to Add, but are allowed to Edit. Example: An Article Administrator that is permitted to edit stories, but is not permitted to post Articles.

	- Add: "Add" grants permission to either add or approve content.

	- Delete: "Delete" is the opposite of "Add". You are granting someone the ability to remove content.

	- Admin: User has ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS to this item.

Admin->Privileges->Add Privileges:
	- Empty: It's possible to create a Privilege which has no access rights itself, but is just a container for others. Selecting EMPTY can to create a 'master container' for other Privileges. ADVANCED: It is possible for a 'master container' to contain access rights. We'll explore that more later. OTTO

	- With Rights: This Privilege, unlike an Empty Privilege, has access rights.

OTTO: To grant Anonymous users read access to the site, add the following privilege:
	- Admin->Privileges: Click "CasualAccess". Under the Privilege drop-down list below Add Privilege To 'CasualAccess', select "ReadAccess" and click "Add" to save changes. Unregistered and Anonymous users now have read access to the site.

OTTO: To allow Registered users to change their theme, post comments, and submit articles, add the following privilege:
	- Admin->Privileges->Add Privilege:

	- Admin->Privileges->View Privileges->View Topics:
	If you would like anonymous users to be able to post comments, change the "Level" field to "Comment" and click "Update" to save changes.

XARAYA ROLES: USERS & GROUPS
============================
Introduction to Roles
---------------------
Roles allow you to manage Users and Groups on your site. Roles are representations of Users and the different Groups to which they can belong.

Roles can be members of other Roles, to any degree. You can, for instance, use Roles to represent a company's organization chart, or the set of classes at a university. A Role can be a member of as many other Roles as you like (as long as the parents are Groups).

Roles can be assigned Privileges. By doing so, you define what a given Role may or may not do on the site. You can use the test function of the Roles module to see what parts of the site a Role with a given set of Privileges has access to.

Roles have inheritance. A Role inherits all the Privileges of all of its parents, but can override these inherited privileges. If you give a group editing privileges, for instance, any other Role that is a member of that Group inherits the editing privileges. If you want to restrict the privileges of some of the members, simply assign them a different set of privileges, and the privileges of the parent will be overridden.

How to use Roles?
-----------------
The Roles on your site are displayed in a tree under Admin->Roles->View All Groups. At the top of the tree is a Role called Everybody, which represents the "group of all groups" on your site. Every User and every Group is a member or descendent of the Everybody Role.

Xaraya comes preconfigured with a minimal set of Roles that are loaded when you run the installer. This configuration is shown below:

				Everybody
				|
				|---Anonymous
				|
				|---Administrators
				|   |
				|   |---Admin
				|
				|---Users

	- Everybody: The Role containing all other roles. This Role has no access privileges.

	- Anonymous: A user that represents ALL unregistered users on your site. This Role is initially configured with Privileges only to access the front page of the site and the login block.

	- Administrators: A group that has administration privileges.

	- Admin: A member of Administrators group. This is the Admin role you create with the Xaraya installer.

	- Users: A group that normally holds registered users of the site. This role is not preconfigured with any privileges. Members of this Group will not have access to the site until you assign privileges.

The preconfigured Roles cannot be changed or removed. However, you can add members to them. You can also define as many more Roles in the tree as you wish in whatever configuration you choose.

Always keep in mind: When you create a role, until you've assigned privileges to it, the role will only have the privileges it inherited from its parents.

- Admin->Roles->View All Groups:
This panel displays a tree-view of all Roles on the site. The following options are available for each Role:
	- Admin->Roles->View All Groups->"X" icon: Delete this Role. It is not possible to delete a Role that contains any users. If you wish to delete a Role, first remove all the users from the Role. When there are no users assigned to a Role, the Delete icon becomes available.

	- Admin->Roles->View All Groups->"Two people" icon: Display users assigned to this Role.
		- View All: View all users in this Role.

		- View Inactive: View inactive users in this Role.

		- View Not Validated: View users in this Role who have not yet validated their account.

		- View Active: View only active users in this Role.
		
	Click the name of a specific user to go to a Modify User Role panel where the selected user can be edited, or added to (or removed from) a particular Role.

	The Show Users screen allows you to delete a specific user, view the privileges assigned to a specific user, or to test the privileges of a specific user. Click the icon for the function you wish to utilize. See below for an explaination of these functions.
	
	- Admin->Roles->View All Groups->"Envelope" icon: Send a plain-text email to all members of this Role.
	The following variables are available to be used in the Subject or Body of the email (see Site Emails, below, for more information on using variables):
		%%name%% 	Display name for the user on the site

		%%sitename%% 	Site Name

		%%siteadmin%% 	Name of the site administrator

		- Subject: Enter the subject of your email message in this field.

		- Message: Enter the body of your email message in this field.

		- Click "Submit" to send email.

	- Admin->Roles->View All Groups->"Arrow pointing down at person" icon: Show the Privileges assigned to this Role.
		Privileges are displayed in two categories:
			- Inherited Privileges
				- Name: The name of the privilege

				- Realm: The realm in which the privilege exists

				- Module: The specific module affected by the privilege

				- Component: The module component affected by the privilege

				- Instance: The instance affected by the privilege

				- Level: The access level of the privilege

				- From Group: The group from which the privileges were inherited. Click the privilege name to view it.

			- Assigned Privileges
				- Name: The name of the privilege

				- Realm: The realm in which the privilege exists

				- Module: The specific module affected by the privilege

				- Component: The module component affected by the privilege

				- Instance: The instance affected by the privilege

				- Level: The access level of the privilege
				
			- If a privilege can be removed, a "Remove" link is displayed in the far right column. Click "Remove" to delete the privilege. Only directly-assigned privileges can be removed from this panel.

		Assign a Privilege to Role <rolename>:
			- Privilege Drop-down list
			
			- Click "Add" to assign privilege.

	- Admin->Roles->View All Groups->"Arrows swirling around person" icon: Test this Role's Privileges
		- Registered Masks for this Module: Select a module from the drop-down list. The screen will update with a list of Masks for the module. Click the mask against which you want to test privileges. The selected user/group is tested against that mask, and if the user/group is permitted to perform the action, a PERMITTED message is displayed. If the user/group is not permitted to perform the action, a NOT PERMITTED message is displayed.

		- Click "Test" to perform test.

* Admin->Mail->Modify config:

* If you are installing any modules from the Xaraya Modules distribution, follow these steps:
	- If you did not download them Xaraya Modules distribution already, download it from http://www.xaraya.com. The Xaraya Module distribution is available in ZIP & TAR.GZ format. Select the archive type that works best for your system (ie, Windows users should select ZIP files) and download the Xaraya Modules distribution from the Downloads section of http://www.xaraya.com.

	- Using the appropriate unarchiving utility, unarchive the Xaraya Module distribution into a temporary directory. For example, on Linux:
		- "cd /tmp"

		- "mkdir xar-mod"

		- "cd /tmp/xar-mod"

		- "tar -xzvf <XarayaModules.tar.gz>"

	- Identify the modules you'd like to use on your site. For the purpose of this document, we will install the following modules from the Xaraya Modules distribution:
		- bbcode -- allows the insertion of BBcode (http://postguestbook.sourceforge.net/bbcode/pbc_manual/book1.html)

		- censor -- allows filtering of objectionable words

		- ephemerids -- display "today in history"

		- headlines -- allows display of RSS-syndicated feeds

		- html -- allows configuration of allowable HTML entities

		- quotes -- displays a random quote on your site

		- recommend -- allows your users to recommend your site to others

		- referer -- displays how visitors are locating your site

		- stats -- displays site visit statistics

	- Move the identified modules into the modules/ directory of your Xaraya Core's temporary directory. For example, on Linux:
		- "cd /tmp/xar-mod"

		- "cp -rf bbcode/ /tmp/xar/html/modules"

		- Repeat for additional modules you'd like to include in your Xaraya installation.

	- Clean up your files from the temporary directory. For example, under Linux:
		- "cd /tmp"

		- "rm -R xar-mod"

	- CENSOR (this is an optinally-installed module from the Xaraya Modules distribution):
		CHECK Articles
			Check the Article Types for which you'd like the Censor module be activated, for example:
				- CHECK News Articles

				- CHECK Reviews

				- CHECK FAQs

				- Check any additional Article Types as you wish.

		CHECK Comments

		CHECK Ephemerids

		CHECK Headlines

OTTO: ADD HOOKS FROM MODULE DISTRIBUTION?

MAINTAINING YOUR XARAYA SITE
============================
This section deals the day-to-day operation of a Xaraya site. It is under development.

OTTO: Does Xaraya have a best practices for routine maintence?

In general, Xaraya runs without any need for pre-emptive or recurring maintenance. However, some things that Xaraya does need recurring maintenance. Here are a few things that should be done on a regular basis:

* Print and clear web statistics. The statistics and log files can grow without limit and needs to be cleared from time to time.

To clear the log files, log in as Administrator and go to the Administration menu. Go to Admin->Referer->View (note that the misspelling is intentional). A listing of site referrers is displayed. Click the "Delete Referers" button to clear the referrers list. NOTE: You are not asked to confirm your intention to delete. New referrers will be added to the cleared list. Generally, the referrers list should be cleared about once a week, or on an interval that is suitable for your site.

* Optimize tables. As tables grow, they can become fragmented and need to be optimized to improve performance.

You must use an external utility to optimize the database tables.

* Backup the database. Although many webmasters have copies of their website on their local workstations, they often neglect to make a copy of their database. A backup of both website and database needs to be done regularly to protect against catastrophic data-loss situations.

You must use an external utility to optimize the database tables. Drew Vogel has written a useful script for backing up the web site's database and files. This script is available below.

# xaraya-bu.sh | 1.12
#==============+ by Drew Vogel (drew@xaraya.com)
# This script will:
#       * Backup files from the <webdir> (recursive) into a file in the
#         root directory called webdir.tar.gz
#       * Perform a dump of the Xaraya database into a file
#         called Xaraya.sql in the root directory,
#       * Archive all backup up files into one archive,
#       * Copy the archive to a specified location, and
#       * Clean up all its temp files.
#
# Define some variables
#
# In BACKUP_TABS, put a list of database table names, separated by a space,
# that you would like to backup from MySQL.
BACKUP_TABS="Xaraya"
#
# MYSQL_USER is your MySQL administrator username.
#
MYSQL_USER=username
#
# MYSQL_PASSWORD is your MySQL administrator password.
#
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
#
# DATE stores the format of the filename. In this case, it results in a XAR prefix with
# a date string, like: XAR-23Oct2002.
#
DATE=$(date +XAR-%d%b%Y)
#
# Change the two lines below to the directory you want to backup.
#
cd /var/www/html
#
# The script itself
#
echo "Backing up /var/www/html/ directory to archive webdir.tar.gz..."
tar -cpzvf ~/webdir.tar.gz *
echo "...done."
cd ~/
        for TAB in $BACKUP_TABS;do
                echo "Creating dump of $TAB database..."
                mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD -B $TAB -c -a --add-drop-table >~/$TAB.sql
                echo "...done."
        done
echo "Adding the files to archive $DATE.tar.gz..."
cd ~/
#
# Edit the line below to include the tablenames from the database.

echo "...done."
#
# Edit the line below to specify the destination directory.
#
echo "Copying $DATE.tar.gz archive to /var/www..."
cd ~/
#
# Edit the line below to specify the destination directory.
#
cp $DATE.tar.gz /var/www/
chmod 770 /var/www/$DATE.tar.gz
#
# Edit the line below to specify the destination directory.

echo "...done."
echo "Cleaning up..."
cd ~/
        for TAB in $BACKUP_TABS;do
                echo "CLEAN UP: Deleting $TAB..."

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY
-----------
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

APPENDIX C: Creating the Xaraya database via phpMyAdmin
=======================================================
If Xaraya successfully created your database, skip to "Administrator Account Creation", below. If Xaraya cannot create the database for you, you should use phpMyAdmin to create an empty database called "Xaraya" and configure access permissions. This can be a two-step process:
	- Using phpMyAdmin, create a user in the database if necessary
	If you already have a database username & password, skip this step. To create a database user <db-user> with password <db-user-password>, follow these steps in phpMyAdmin:
		- Click "Privileges".

		- Click "Add new User" and complete the fields.
			- User name: Use text field: Type the name for the user in the text field. This is the same value as <db-user>, above.
			
			- Host: If the database is running on the same server as the website (this is the most common scenario), select "Local" from the drop-down list.

			- Password: Use text field: Type the password for this user in the text field. This is the same value as <db-user-password>, above.
		
			- Re-type the password to verify.
		
			- Click "Go" to save changes.

	- Using phpMyAdmin, create the empty Xaraya database (called "Xaraya")
	In phpMyAdmin, follow these steps to create the database that Xaraya will use:
		- Create a new database called "Xaraya".

		- Click the "Home" link near the top left of the phpMyAdmin page.

		- Click "Databases".

		- Next to the line for Xaraya, click "Check Privileges".

		- Next to <db-user>, click "Edit".

		- Check all in "Edit Privileges" and click "Go".

		- Click the "Home" link near the top left of the phpMyAdmin page.

		- Click "Reload MySQL".

	- Once the empty "Xaraya" database has been created, re-run the Xaraya installer and UNCHECK "Create the database" under Database Settings Collection.

APPENDIX D: Enabling Short URL support in Apache 2.x
====================================================
Short URLs work without modifying your Apache 1.x configuration.

If you are running Apache 2.x on your webserver and wish to support Short URLs, you must add the directive:
	AcceptPathInfo On
to your httpd.conf file (usually /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf on RedHat systems). Restart Apache once the change has been saved ("apachectl graceful" on RedHat systems). See the documentation on the Apache website for more information about adding this directive.

APPENDIX E: Creating a Xaraya Theme
===================================
How to create a Xaraya Theme
http://www.mahmood.tv/index.php/docs/20

I gave http://www.computerpoint.tv a make-over in less than a couple of hours, and that included installing Xaraya, importing the previous PostNuke 0.723 data AND creating the theme! Themes with BlockLayout are extremely easy. I am sure I haven't even scratched the surface or capabilities of the BlockLayout templating engine, but I got it done, here's how:

1. Copy the Xaraya_Classic theme into whatever name you like your new theme to be, let's say 'MacyGray':

# cd <xarroot>/themes
# cp -R Xaraya_Classic MacyGray

2. Reserve an ID on Xaraya.com and note the ID you've chosen. Edit the <xarroot>/themes/MacyGray/xartheme.php file and enter your Theme ID there. While in that file, change all other information that needs to change like the theme name, directory etc. In vi I do:

:g/Xaraya_Classic/s//MacyGray/g

that will replace all occurances of 'Xaraya_Classic' with 'MacyGray'

To do the same for all other files in <xarroot>/themes/MacyGray, do a grep to see where 'Xaraya_Classic' occurs then change that as I've done above in vi or whatever editor you use:

# cd themes/MacyGray
# grep -R Xaraya_Classic *

This will spew all occurances of Xaraya_Classic in all the files in the directory and the subdirectories, then go to each file and do a replace as above.

3. Now that you have the basic framework for MacyGray, it is time to get creative!

Use your HTML editor to load <xarroot>/themes/MacyGray/default.xt.

Load up <xarroot>/themes/MacyGray/style.css file to ensure that you're working on the complete theme and to avoid surprises! There is a LOT of information and control in the style.css file and you can change just about anything in the theme by changing values in the style.css file. It is also here that you would change the page background color, fonts to use, font attributes, etc. Again your HTML editor should give you a way to change things in the stylesheet in a graphical environment.

Place graphics and other elements. Basically, create your theme here then save the files.

4. Check that your HTML editor didn't screw up the graphic paths, make sure that your graphics are in "<xarroot>/themes/MacyGray/images/" directory, rather than "file:///".

5. Everything saved, make sure that the permissions on the files and directories are set appropriately.

6. Go to the Admin->Themes->View Themes. CHECK "Regenerate" and click "Reload". Then initialize and activate your new theme.

7. Go to Admin->Themes->Modify config and set your new theme as the default...

et voila! Now you have a new theme for Xaraya!!

For variables and tags to use (if you need more that is, you could check the BlockLayout RFC on Xaraya.com)

APPENDIX F: Converting from PostNuke to Xaraya
==============================================
Conversion of an existing PostNuke site to Xaraya is easy.

A conversion script facilitates the conversion process for PostNuke versions . The import script will not import PostNuke items if there is no specific script that handles that part of the data. During conversion, PostNuke data is converted and stored in the new Xaraya tables. The original PostNuke data is not modified in any way.

To convert from PostNuke to Xaraya, follow the steps below.
	1. Backup existing PN database to a file, just to be safe. For example:
		- "mysqldump -u <username> -p -B <PostNuke_dbase_name> -c -a --add-drop-table >PNbackup.sql"

	2. If you have many articles (more than 250 or so) on your PostNuke site, it may be necessary to increase PHP's max_execution_time to prevent timeouts when converting and importing data. If max_execution_time is too low, PHP may 'time out' before the articles can be imported successfully.
		- To adjust the max_execution_time, edit /etc/php.ini and set max_execution_time to 120, making a note of the previous value. Save the file and exit the editor. Restart your webserver so the changes are implemented ("apachectl restart", for example).

	3. From the Xaraya Base distribution, install a Xaraya Community site. In the Database Name field of Xaraya's installer, specify the name of your existing PostNuke database (case-sensitive). Specify a different prefix for Xaraya's tables ("xar" is recommended) than was used for PostNuke.

	4. Install the POLLS module in Xaraya. If you skip this step, the importer will present an error when it tries to import any polls that exist on your PostNuke site.

	5. Copy the import_pn*.php files from the Xaraya Base distribution's "/tests/import/postnuke" directory to your <xarroot> directory. Give the <xarroot>/import_pn*.php files appropriate system permissions and ownership so they can be accessed via the web. For example:
		- "cp /test/import/postnuke/import_pn*.php <xarroot>"

		- "cd <xarroot>"

		- "chown -R web:apache import_pn*.php"

		- "chmod -R 770 import_pn*.php"

	6. From a browser, go to http://www.yourwebsite.com/<xarroot>/import_pn.php. Follow the on-screen steps to import each area of the PostNuke site into Xaraya.

	7. After the conversion is complete, delete the import_pn*.php files from your <xarroot> directory. Leaving these files can present a security risk.

	8. Edit /etc/php.ini and set max_execution_time back to the previous value. Save and exit the editor. Restart your webserver so the changes are implemented ("apachectl restart", for example).
	
	9. If you no longer intend to run PostNuke, the PostNuke tables can be deleted from the database using the command line or phpMyAdmin.

After conversion, the PostNuke tables in the database may be deleted, if desired.
