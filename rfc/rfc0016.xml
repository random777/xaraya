            <t>
            I've gone through the SF feature requests and compiled a list of requirements for the new User module 
            and a flow for the new user registration process.  They're in pretty rough form but should be 
            understandable, please take a look through and let me know if I've missed anything.

                User states like this define whether a user is capable of logging on or not. So we might have states 
                like:
                </t>
                <t>
                <list>
                    <t> - disabled - admin deactivated
                    </t>
                    <t>- expired - time deactivated
                    </t>
                    <t>- pending - awaiting admin approval
                    </t>
                    <t>- unconfirmed - awaiting confirmation that email address of user is correct
                    </t>
                    <t>- active - normal state
                    </t>
                </list>
                </t>
               </list>
               </t>
            <t>
            And the user could only log on if the account was active. This would allow subscription-based sites 
            along with better admin control than at current, where the only way an admin could lock out a user is to 
            delete their account or change their password, neither of which would give a very useful error message 
            to the user.
            </t>
            <t>
            Group membership would probably come in to play for viewing content on the site, but the actual state 
            of the user is a separate thing. 
            </t>

                Modules should be able to plug into the users module to offer configuration screens. This could be 
                accomplished with a hook that is registered by the module for the display of the user settings 
                screen in the users module. The search module uses a similar implementation.
