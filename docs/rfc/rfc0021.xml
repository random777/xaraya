                           RFC-21 Postnuke International June 2002
1. Introduction 
 The goal of Postnuke International is to leverage the international nature of the
 PostNuke project to further various aspects of the project, including, but not limited to:
Support 
PR 
User Feedback 
Documentation 
Having Fun 
2. List of requirements for Postnuke International 
Provide Support in many languages 
Share experiences 
Have a common backend to share content 
Create an escalation procedure for unresolved problems 
Increase traffic to partner sites 
Resolve scalability issues with the main support site 
Foster local communities 
Attract talent to PostNuke 
Spread the word about PostNuke 
Raise quality accross all sites 
 Some of the problems we want to address with Postnuke International are:
Language barriers: not everyone speaks / understands english 
Support information is hard to find 
It is hard to discover language / country specific PostNuke sites 
Problem reports tend not to flow back to the developers 
Translated documenation is sometimes hard to find 
International Support without support 
News of Postnuke only in Postnuke site and not translated and put i all sites 
Developpers, maybe other country have a good developper but they not speak/understand english 
Postnuke project don't have Official International Support site 
Comunication with Official Postnuke and other support site 
News: Postnuke.com -> International sites (by hand, webmasters checking postnuke.com, modules.*, blocks.* themes.*, mailing lists..., broswing forums..., other international sites...) 
Documentation: Flow broken. There are part of documentation on docs.postnuke.com, part on international sites. Without consistency of content and/or look. 
Feedback: Needs to be more dinamic. Bug report on a non english site by a non english speaker right now means webmaster to understand completely bug to submit it. Some bug fixing is done on the fly on country/language specific sites 
FAQ: Make a real FAQs based on experience of language-based support teams. It'll help on the way of developing end user and administrator documentation 
3. Solution proposals 
 Here are some partial solution ideas. Those need to be fleshed out a lot more.
Syndication of news, forums (Mailbag?) to exchange news, forward interesting threads for archival or as input for pnFeedback (bug tracker / feature request). close the loop with the documentation / FAQ team 
Heavy, deep interlinking (not just in the web links section) for instance on pn.it forum: go to the same forum on pn.com etc 
Adopt a similar structure for the support forums so that they can be mapped from language to language, from main site to 3rd party sites etc 
Make documentation readily available (people have trouble finding our docs, including translations 
Make sure people read the FAQ before they ask problems, and related, create escalation steps to verify issues so that they can be tackled by developers. 
Work with documentation people to continually identify top issues, and make FAQ / docs out of them 
Create language-specific IRC channels on the PostNuke IRC Network 
5. Relationship of Postnuke International to other areas 
pnCommunity: Postnuke International should plug into pnCommunity for User Feedback and other areas 
 6.  Code that will need to be rewritten
News submission should support multiple destinations

11. Open Issues 
Contested Sites 
 In many cases there are two or more Postnuke sites per country. Agreeing on one official site per
 country is highly unlikely. The goal should be to have as many sites as part of Postnuke International
 as possible while still maintaining the quality of the network. Examples of contested sites include:
postnuke.de versus post-nuke.com 
various french sites - Do anybody have links of french sites besides Boomtchak? 
various scandinavian sites - This issue was solved imho? 
pure PostNuke sites vs sites with mixed content 
Uniformity vs Creative Freedom 
 The wish to achieve some level of uniformity among sites of Postnuke International might
 clash with the wish to do things differently.
