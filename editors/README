   -> useful guid for installing, specifically targetted to the XSL variety 
      of docbook, which we use

Tips:

1. Get a good editor! be it visual or bare-bones, but get one which is
   able to validate your docbook musings and help you write the proper tags. Nothing is
   so boring as to go through an invalid xml file afterwards. 

2. Docbook is huge. Dont try to outsmart it ;-)

3. Content structure first, presentation later. It's no use thinking about indentation, fonts,
   sizes, colors and everything else while writing docbook. It's all about the content and
   designating that content semantically with the right tags. The better structured, the
   nicer the layout can be, because the styler has more to work with. Use the tags!
