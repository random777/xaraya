    <abstract>
      <t>
        This RFC presents a proposal for a universal system of defining objects in Xaraya and managing the relationships between them. It does not look at content issues within the objects themselves. Rather, it covers the way different objects in Xaraya can be related to each other, and how they can interact in creating, modifying and sharing content.
      </t>
      <t>
        The proposal is conceptually divided into two parts. In the first we define the formalism to manage the diverse types of objects that Xaraya supports in a consistent fashion. This includes setting up a standard API that all objects adhere to.
      </t>
      <t>        
        In the second part we look at the way in which objects can interact with each other through their API.Some basic structures for the resulting object hierarchy are defined, as well as mechanism for dynamically creating richer structures.
