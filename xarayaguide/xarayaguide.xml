      <para>Drew Vogel has been involved with Xaraya since its inception --
      when it was known by the code-name "ProjectX". In fact, Drew hosted the
      first-ever ProjectX Summit (August 23-28, 2002) in Cincinnati
      Ohio.</para>

      <para>Drew earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater Directing &amp;
      Performance with a minor in English Literature focusing on Shakespearean
      literature from Northern Kentucky University (1991). He works at the
      University of Cincinnati College of Pharmacy as Manager of Professional
      Programs. His outside interests include gourmet cooking, fine dining,
      scuba diving, urban exploration, sports cars, computer technology,
      animals, reading, movies, travel, music, and humor. And more.</para>

      <para>Drew's interest in documentation is an effort to bridge the gap
      between developers and users of software. He acts as an intermediary
      between these groups with their seperate needs.</para>

      <para>When not working on documentation projects, Drew is typically
      reading cookbooks or other food-related books &amp; magazines, or
      creating culinary masterpieces in his home kitchen.</para>

      <para>Drew lives in Cincinnati, Ohio with his fiancee Wendy, four cats,
      and two dogs. His website is at <ulink

    <title>Xaraya configuration File</title>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you really want to, you can use the old fashioned way of
          editing the config file yourself.</para>

          <para>Using your text editor, edit
          <filename>/tmp/xar/html/var/config.system.php</filename> and make
          the following changes as necessary:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Database Username: The username that will be used to
              connect to the database. Do not use 'root' or 'admin' account
              names as they present a security risk. This user should already
              exist and have privileges in your database. For example, if the
              database user was to be "db-user", change the line to:</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.UserName'] =
              'db-user';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Database Password: The password that will be used to
              connect to the database. For example, if the database password
              was to be "db-user-password", change the line to:</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.Password'] =
              'db-user-password';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Database Host: The host name where the database server is
              located. In most cases this will be 'localhost'. Otherwise, you
              need to include a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) here, for
              example, 'mybox.mydomain.com' or the IP number of the machine.
              For example, if the database host was to be "localhost" (meaning
              that the database is on the same server as Xaraya), change the
              line to:</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.Host'] =
              'localhost';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Database Name: The name of the database to which to
              connect. Case-sensitive.</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.Name'] =
              'Xaraya';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Database Type: The database server type.</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.Type'] =
              'mysql';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Database TablePrefix: Used when you wish to run multiple
              sites off the same database. That way, user accounts will be
              available across all the sites. This feature is not currently
              implemented into Xaraya, but will be available in a future
              release. The prefix chosen here will be prepended to each of the
              tables of your database to give each a unique name across
              multiple installs. For example, if the database table prefix was
              to be "xar", change the line to look like this:</para>

              <para><command>$systemConfiguration['DB.TablePrefix'] =
              'xar';</command></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Save your changes and exit your editor.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
