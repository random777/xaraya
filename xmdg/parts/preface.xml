    <para>Xaraya has been released in 2005 as version 1.0, after more than
    five years of development. This long time has garanteed for a profoundly
    good product.</para>

    <para>The initial installation package includes core functionality for a
    basic content management solution listing of registered modules on
    Xaraya.com includes sixty-two content-based modules registered for a
    certified Xaraya identification number. Thirty-nine of those modules are
    currently completed or under development by members of the Xaraya
    development team.</para>

    <para>Third party developers have a concept or idea that they want to
    contribute to the project, but lack the proper tools that will allow them
    to submit API<footnote>

      </footnote> compliant modules for certification. A series of polls
    posted on Xaraya websites have revealed the need for this type of training
    document and have produced a list of suggested modules to choose from for
    use as examples in the development guide. Current research for this
    project was conducted by reading through the Xaraya code, developer
    comments and notes as well as existing documentation located in the beta
    repositories.</para>

    <para>Xaraya is an extensible, open source platform written in
    PHP<footnote>
        <para>PHP is a widely used general-purpose scripting language that is
        especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into

    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
    License</ulink>. Xaraya utilizes permissions, data management, and modular
    systems to dynamically integrate and manage content. Xaraya's modular,
    database independent architecture introduces the need for add-on modules
    that will enhance its functionality and produce a customizable solution
    that will meet any web masters needs.</para>
