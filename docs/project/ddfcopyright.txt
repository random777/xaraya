Preface 
------- 
This contains a proposal for handling the copyright of
contributors to the Xaraya code-base.

Definition of code-base:
"all contents of the core repository" 

Definition of contributor:
"any person who added or modified a file in the code-base"

The proposal will focus on a small area of tasks and problems we have
started to solve in the past, but have not been able to follow
through. The PMC wants to solve at least the critical points of those
areas before 1.0 is released.

Goal of the proposal
--------------------
"A clear definition and procedure on how the collective copyright is
assigned and protected with the absolute minimal effort, while keeping
as much of the options, which we earlier planned for, open for future
endeavors"

The proposal will NOT deal with related issues, it will just present a
short term list of actions which are necessary from the point of view
of the PMC. The PMC feels it is partly its responsibility to protect
the copyright and efforts of our contributors. While we acknowledge
that these other issues are important and should be dealt with
eventually, we consciously decide NOT to deal with them NOW.

Some of these related issues are for example:
- how to manage membership of the DDF
- when the DDF will act on copyright infringements / when not
- a procedure for requesting such an action
- how to deal with contributor who are not ddf members

Problem scope
-------------
In our original plans for the DDF and Xaraya the setup was, at least
conceptually, rather clear. The DDF would be the umbrella above a
number of projects and provide services to the members of those
projects which would unite in the DDF by becoming a member of the
foundation and agreeing to transfer copyrights to this foundation, so
the protection and handling of those rights could be managed centrally.

This setup has been disturbed by a number or factors, for which we
will not go into detail at this point. Suffice to say that the currently
implemented organizational structure is insufficient for the majority
of the needs for a project such as Xaraya. This proposal will only
focus on one part of these needs: "Copyright protection", nothing more,
nothing less. We would like to see this reflected in the discussion.

Copyright protection
--------------------
Copyright is assigned by default, you don't have to actually *do*
anything to get copyright on something you write or design. It is
however advisable to confirm that copyright for obvious reasons.
Solely judging from the above the absolute simplest course of action
would be to re-confirm the copyright statements in the code-base as
defined and make sure they are correct and valid.

We use these definitions for "valid" and "correct":
valid  : assigned to a legal entity or person
correct: assigned to the proper contributor

To be clear on what constitutes a valid and correct copyright statement:
- "copyright Xaraya development group" is NOT VALID and NOT CORRECT as that is no entity
- "no copyright statement" is VALID and CORRECT, copyright is implicit
- "copyright <specific contributor-name>" is VALID and POSSIBLY CORRECT 
- "copyright <list of specific contributors>" is VALID and POSSIBLY CORRECT
- "copyright Digital Development Foundation" is VALID and POSSIBLY CORRECT (see below)

First problem to be solved:
===========================
"Eliminate the invalid, unconfirmed and incorrect copyright in the
code-base"

A copyright holder needs to exercise his rights under that copyright,
both passively (making sure it is confirmed) and actively (acting on
copyright infringes) and pro-actively (making sure there exists no
misunderstanding about the copyright) 

In short: a copyright holder has obligations in general, and for open
source this is even a greater burden, because it is the *only*
protection available for the contributor(s).

Even shorter: copyright must be managed

Added to this is the fact that the code-base for Xaraya has multiple
contributors in general and multiple contributors per file. (on last
count, we have around 200 contributors in our code-base), so the
management of all this copyright can be a daunting task, especially
when the code-base is so large and functioning as a whole.

Second problem to be solved:
===========================
"Make the management of the copyright doable on both short term and
long term taking a changing composition of the group of original
contributors into account."

The obvious solution is to transfer copyright to a central entity
which focusses solely on the management of that copyright. Each
contributor agrees to sign a document to transfer his copyright to
that entity. We, obviously, had the DDF in mind for this, which brings
us to the third problem:

Third problem to be solved:
===========================
"Create a mode of operation for the DDF in which the management of
copyright need can be handled efficiently, the management of the
copyright of contributors to the Xaraya code-base."


SUMMARY
=======
To sum up, this proposal aims to formulate explicit actions to solve
the following 3 problems:

1. Eliminate the invalid and incorrect copyright situation;
2. Make the management of copyright efficient and realistic;
3. Create a mode of operation in the DDF to manage the copyright;

All 3 problems are problems on their own; i.e. a possible outcome
could be to solve problems 1 and 2, while not solving problem 3. The
"order" of the problems is however important and need to be solved in
the order specified.

There are a lot of options which would solve these
problems. For practical purposes the PMC would like to offer two, and
only two, options at this time:

1. We vote on the proposal actions as presented here and exercise it as a
group if voted in.

2. Everyone manages their own copyright and we remove all copyright
references to non-entities and the DDF.

These are the *only* two options we can offer at this moment and for
which the PMC is willing to make an effort to create the momentum and
execute the appropriate actions. To be harsh, we can not, at this
time, start a process of discussing other options or scenarios for
execution before the 1.0 release of Xaraya.


Executing the actions to solve the above problems
=================================================
For each of the problems we have formulated atomic actions which need
to be performed. Some will require a vote, others can be executed
immediately.

0. Resources
------------
Marc Lutolf and Marcel van der Boom have agreed to lead and
co-ordinate all the actions required and making sure we complete all
of them before the 1.0 release of Xaraya

VOTES ON: Mandating marc + marcel to implement the procedure on
          behalf of the contributors.

1. Eliminate the invalid copyright and ensure it is correct
-----------------------------------------------------------
Action:
1.1 All copyright statements in all relevant places are changed to one
    of the choices below:

a) Copyright (c) years, The Digital Development Foundation
b) Copyright (c) years, <list of contributors>

Notes:
a) requires problem 2 solution
b) list of contributors will be produced with the help of bitkeeper

VOTES ON: 1.1

Notes:
- action implies a) or b) depending on solutions 2 and 3
 
2. Make the copyright manageable 
--------------------------------
Actions: 

2.1 A form will be created which needs to be signed by *each*
    contributor at least identified by name and email-address. These 
    signed forms will be collected by the PMC.

2.2 This form will include a statement that the contributor agrees
    the copyright can be managed by the PMC on their behalf if
    needed.

2.3 This form will include a statement that the contributor agrees,
    that the copyright of their contribution will be transferred to the
    Digital Development Foundation

2.4 No contribution will be accepted without a signed copy (either
    digitally or on paper) of the aforementioned form

Notes:
- action 2.2 is essential, note that the copyright is not transferred to the
  PMC, but PMC gets merely a mandate for keeping an eye on infringements and
  speaking on behalf of the contributor to handle it. If action is required, PMC
  must seek approval from each contributor.
- action 2.3 requires solution 3, if solution 3 is voted down, action 2.3 is
  left out.

VOTES ON: The set of actions as a whole

3. Create a mode of operation in the DDF to manage the copyright
----------------------------------------------------------------
Actions:

3.1 The current DDF BOD will be dismissed from their duties

3.2 An interim DDF BOD / management is voted in which has the goal of
    implementing this proposal, after which new BOD elections will take
    place. This interim BOD will get a mandate from the ddf members to take the
    decisions necessary to implement this proposal.

3.3 After implementing the goal, the interim BOD reports on the
    completed copyright transfer to the ddf members and offers a procedure for
    continuing that practice within the DDF.

VOTES ON: 3.1, 3.2 separately.


Note for discussion:
- please regard this proposal as a request for votes. This is the proposal
  we would like to put to a vote, not a completely modified one after discussion.
  If there are too many issues you have with this proposal, reflect that in 
  your vote
- please be aware that we fully realize that there are many more problems to 
  be solved, and we *will* deal with them too at the appropriate time.
