                This document is intended to be the starting point of a specific series
                of initiatives designed to improve overall usability of Xaraya from all
                points-of-view (POV).  This is a living document and, as such, is subject 
                to change.

                Specifically, we expect that some of the issues raised herein may have 
                already been addressed and/or are in the process of being resolved.  As
                these issues are resolved, they will be moved to the "Resolved Issues"
                Appendix.  They will not be removed as this document is intended to be 
                the document of record for all usability concerns.

                Xaraya's target markets/user base are as follows:

                                        Arguably the largest immediate audience of Xaraya,
                                        independent Web Designers/Developers are looking for 
                                        tool that will allow them to quickly deploy a 
                                        robust, yet simple-to-use content management system
                                        for their customers. This market will act as
                                        Administrators for client sites and their clients will
                                        act as Editors/Members.

                                        This market likely mirrors Web Designers/Devs closely.
                                        The differentiator is, in most cases, a small
                                        group or individual will be primarily responsible for
                                        application, content and user administrations
                                    </t>    
                                    <t><spanx>Small-Medium Sized Business Web Presence: </spanx>
                                        The end-customer of the Web Designers/Developers who
                                        have enough knowledge in house to install and administer
                                        Xaraya as a public web presence.  In addition to core
                                        CMS and User Management functionality, this market will
                                        be looking for 3PD eCommerce Plugins as well to allow 
                                        them to conduct business on the web.
                                    </t>    
                                    <t><spanx>Corporate Intranet: </spanx>
                                        Like the Small-Medium Business market, the Corporate
                                        Intranet market has the technical know-how on staff
                                        to install and administer Xaraya themselves.  This 
                                        market will look for specific Core and Plug-In 
                                        components to enable Interop with existing systems. 
                                        Examples include extending Core User components to
                                        use LDAP authentication and support for Oracle and 
                                        Microsoft SQL Server.

                            <t> 
                            As developers first, we all tend to think too technically
                            and, as a result, assume too much know-how on the part of the
                            end-users of the code.  While 3PDs are a valuable audience which
                            needs active and agressive support, they will be best served
                            if we make the underlying Xaraya platform as user-friendly as
                            possible for the non-technical browser/member and content owner/editor.
                            </t>

                            <t>
                                To create clear, effective documentation which enhances usability
                                for all target audiences, clear and consistent nomenclature is  
                                required.  Where appropriate, we have attempted to establish
                                naming conventions and labels we think will be most effective.
                                All of this terminology is open for discussion.  In the end,
                                we need simple, concise definitions that work.

                            Common terminology is a critical component to effectively communicating
                            with one another and with the end-user.  In the past, we have used 
                            the term <spanx>Module</spanx> relatively loosely.  As we more definitively
                            isolate core components more clearly from add-on components, we suggest
                            deprecating the term <spanx>Module</spanx> and adopting the term 
                            <spanx>Component</spanx>.  With this change, we further define Xaraya 
                            Components as follows:
                            <t></t>

                                Core components include all files (module, SQL, docs, 
                                themes, etc.) considered an essential part of the core 
                                distribution of Xaraya.

                                Commonly referred to as <spanx>Modules</spanx>, Plugins include
                                any add-on which either extends a core Component or adds
                                entirely new functionality to Xaraya.

                                Also referred to as <spanx>Skins</spanx>, Themes use BlockLayout
                                to reconfigure the visual user interface (UI) of Xaraya. 
                                Themes can be as subtle as a simple color change and as 
                                radical as a complete redesign of the way th page functions
                                and how information is arranged.

                                    Short for <spanx>Inter-Operability</spanx>, Interop refers to

                                    in meaningful ways.  The primary goals of Interop 
                                    initiatives generally serve both the developer and the
                                    end-user by establishing standards which make it

                    to this directory structure.  One possible solution is listed below.

                            we enable simpler back-ups of content not contained within the DB.

                <spanx>Typeface: </spanx>
                Theme templates should consistently apply typeface across the 
                application.  Basically, all fonts should be controlled by the
                theme CSS. This may already have been addressed in the BL
                implementation.  If so, we still need to keep an eye out for
                legacy font controls from PN which had very inconsistent font
                controls.

                With the exception of content-specific fields, the UI
                tools used to add content should have conistent look-and-feel,
                instructions and other UI elements and processes. In short,
                adding WebLinks should function the same as adding Reviews.

                        Again, Red Hat Network and MS Windows Update are the functionality
                        benchmarks for ease of use. Specifically, Xaraya would ideally
                        have a built in mechanism through which the Administrator can 
                        click a button and have their installation compared to a database
                        residing on Xaraya servers.  Once this comparison is complete,  a 
                        report is generated describing available updates and giving the 
                        Administrator the option of downloading and installing the updates 
                        automatically.

                <t> 
                To truly administer a Xaraya site well, the Administrator needs a strong toolset.  Some
                of the tools are be discussed elsewhere in this document. The following is a current best
                guess at the desired Administrative Utilities Toolset.

                    <t><spanx>Backup Utilities: </spanx>
                        Using platform awareness and available tools, the Administrator need the ability
                        to quickly and efficiently back up his site prior to upgrading.  These tools
                        include Database Backup (phpMyAdmin or similar tool) and File Back Up for the 
                        following Xaraya directories (at a minimum).

                              One interface to edit ALL language files, even those in 
                            component directories (Plugins &amp; Themes). As part of the component registration 
                            process, it would announce the presence/location of the 
                            component language files.
                            <t></t>

                            <t></t>
                            It would be great if there was a default file, say <spanx>eng_override.php</spanx> 
                            (different prefix for other languages, of course) in the 
                            <spanx>/configs</spanx> that would allow over-ride of what's in the language 
                            files, to prevent having to edit the distribution files directly. 
                            For example, in /plugins/<spanx>&lt;plugin_name&gt;</spanx>/lang/eng/global.php, 
                            it has    <spanx>'define("_PRODUCTTITLE","Product title");'</spanx>, but I would 
                            like to override that. 
                            <t></t>
                            So, in eng_override.php, I would be able to do 
                            <spanx>'define("_PRODUCTTITLE","Product/Event title");'</spanx> and have 
                            eng_override.php included at the appropriate times to override 
                            what's in the distribution file if the eng_override.php file 
                            exists. As I edit my distribution language files more and more, 
                            the more I think this feature would be very helpful. If the 
                            eng_override.php file doesn't exist, it would just use the 
                            defaults in the distribution language file.

                        Groups &amp; Permissions GUI was badly in need of an overhaul.
                        Marcinmilan is already hard at work on this.  We are just calling it
                        out here to support his work in progress.

                        the menu block method; it's the most powerful option.

                  One of the core failings of the *Nuke platform is that it only provided
                    two default user roles (Administrator and User).  This approach assumes
                    that the Administrator was also the Content editor in all cases.  
                    Regular usage of *Nukes and user feedback indicates the need for a 
                    third default role (Editor).  Each proposed user role is defined below.

                        No real role change here.  This is the Xaraya equivalent of 
                        <spanx>/root</spanx>.  Just as no Server Admin will give out <spanx>/root</spanx>
                        to just anyone, so to should the Administrator role be tightly
                        guarded.    By default, the Administrator can do <spanx>anything</spanx> 
                        on the system.

                         This is an entirely new default role.  Most Administrators end
                         up creating this sort of role anyway, so it makes sense to 
                         include it as a default.  By default, this role has 
                         <spanx>ONLY</spanx> content and user management (add/approve/modify/delete) 
                         rights.  They have no system configuration, install/upgrade,
                         database access or other global rights to impact the system.

                         additional content and/or services and local user configuration
                         options.  This role has no Administrator/Editor rights.     This
                         role can submit content for publication, but it must be 
                         approved by an Administrator or Editor.

                                at the top of the page. For example, WebLinks is currently 
                                ordered as follows:
                                <t></t>

                                It is more logical, when long-term usage is considered, 
                                to order it as follows:            
                                <t></t>    
                                <list style="numbers">

                                Alternatively, it would be very useful (though probably 
                                difficult to implement) to track usage of Editing Tools 
                                based, perhaps, on page hits.  Armed with this usage data,
                                the system could, upon logon, present the Editor with a

                                        Ideally, Xaraya would be aware if the contents of
                                        an HREF are local (onsite) or external (offsite)
                                        as determined by the presence or absence of 
                                        <spanx>http://</spanx>. The Administrator/Editor would be 
                                        then be able to set a configuration variable which 
                                        would determine if the HREF should pop a new window 
                                        to display the target URL (analagous to target="blank").  
                                        This seting would be global across the site, but 
                                        could be over-ridden on a case-by-case basis.

    <section anchor="Appendix_A" title="Installation Reporting and Automated Update Tools">
    <t>
         It has been suggested that, upon completion of a Xaraya install, the 
         application either automatically ping Xaraya's server and collect information 
         (perceived as spyware by many) or we ask users to register which does the 
         same thing.  For real world examples ... think Windows Update, Red Hat Network
         and the Eclipse Updater Tool.
    </t>
    <t>
         This Reporting Installer could collect all sorts of valuable information
         which, if positioned correctly and paired with a clean and simple opt-out
         process could achieve the following goals:
         <list style="numbers">     
               <t>Accurate Install/Usage statistics with which we can use in ...
                    <t></t>
                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t>Forecasting future installs,</t>
                        <t>Defining Market Share,</t>
                        <t>Fund-raising,</t>
                        <t>Marketing</t>
                    </list>
                    <t></t>
                   </t>
                   <t>
                     Establishes useful user database with as much (or as little) information
                     as we feel is appropriate to maintain about our install base.  This would
                     not be spyware because we would allow folks a simple way to opt-out at the
                     beginning (no optin by default) and if they optout, we would simply add a
                     install tick to the counter and collect no data.
                   </t>
         </list>    
         <t>
           As users elect to opt-in, they share more information about their install
           and intended usage which allows us to do some really cool stuff like ...
         </t>
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>Automated core updates (again, think Eclipse Updater, RHN, WU)</t>
                <t>Detailed market analysis (who is using the site for what ... blogs, music sites, pron, etc)</t>
                <t>Detailed system stats for install base (windows, LAMP, etc)</t>
                <t>Automated YANXS directory</t>
                <t>Security Alerts and Patch Notices via email even SMS or pager</t>
         </list>    
         <t>
           We can work out the details, but you get the idea.  It is not spyware if we
           give them the option to opt-out and tell them if they do, no information
           beyond a "Install Counter tick" will be passed and we could even forgo that
           if we wanted.  IMO, the benefits to everyone (core, user and dev communities
           alike) and hurts no one.

    <t>
         As the name implies, <spanx>Site Kits</spanx> are a series of pre-configured 
         Xaraya tarballs    (Core + Modules).  As frame of reference, think of the
         Red Hat GUI-based Installer. For example ...
            </t>
            <t> <spanx>Red Hat:</spanx> What sort of install is this?

            <t>
                Like the Red Hat example, Xaraya Site Kits would install and configure
                pre-built packages based on user choice.  The Xaraya example may look like this ...

         As you can see, the possibilities are boundless.  The advantages of this sort of functionality are manifold ...
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>
             It engages 3PDs in much the same way the Red Hat installer and RHN does.
             It gives them a framework within which to simply distribute their work and a
             clear incentive to use that framework guidelines (xDeveloper Guide) to the
             letter.
           </t>
           <t>
             It provides a distinct competitive advantage over other OS CMS as it
             makes us the most configurable tool while making said configuration as
             simple for the end user as possible.
           </t>
           <t>
             It shows foresight and planning which will invite/attract other, bigger
             development partners (IBM, etc) and helps us cement Xaraya as something more
             than garage project like PN or PHP-Nuke.
           </t>
           <t>
             Along with things like LDAP authentication, SOAP support and other
             Interop tools, it provides a possible entree into larger corporate install
             base.
           </t>
           <t>
             Driven by BL, it makes Xaraya the platform of choice for independent
             small to medium sized web developers looking for a way to provide dynamic
             websites without knowing how to code.  They do the install, retheme and
             viola.
           </t>
           <t>
             It makes us a viable option for small to medium business owners looking
             for a way to establish a web presence at low cost.  If they have a bit of
             tech savvy they can do it themselves.
           </t>
           <t>
             Opens the doors for schools (K through University) and other Non-Profits
             to establish web presence is a simple, cost-efficient manner. They may pay
             their ad agency to develop their theme/look, or better yet call on the body
             of Xaraya developers/designers to do so, and save the development costs.  At
             the HS and University level, they may also grow a new generation of  Xaraya
             devs by engaging their students in module development.
           </t>
           <t>
             Instantly breaks the current OS CMS mold which will certainly lead to
             considerable positive exposure for this project in the OS media and in
           </t>
         </list>
         <t>
           Lots of food for thought here ... but the bottom line is this sort of
           feature/module will go a long way to further killing installer usability
           concerns, maintaining an active, engaged an loyal community and rebuilding a
           loyal install base for Xaraya.

            These ideas require a more mature, stable Xaraya release to begin feasibility
            review.  They are captured here because ultimately, they serve both the project 
            (wider distribution channels) and the end-users (ease of installation).
