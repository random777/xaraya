-- 
-- Part of pre-commit triggers
-- 
-- @global stat_table contains a parsed basic_io stanza to use for running a test.
-- @glocal commit_file is a list of files in the commit (renamed and patched only)
--
-- Explanation of flow:
-- 1. User issues a mtn commit statement and enters his commit message
-- 2. The hook validate_commit_message runs
-- 3. Each (lua) file in the configured pre-commit location is run in alphabetical
--    order where stat_table is available as table with the parsed basic_io stanza
-- 4. if a test issues an error, the remaining ones are not executed
--
print('--- Group 0: System checks ---')
