  <title>Introduction &amp; Information about Xaraya</title>

  <para>This chapter will give you an introduction to Xaraya, it's features,
  the format of this Guide, and the assumptions under which this Guide was
  written. Also included is a handy Xaraya pronunciation guide!</para>

  <sect1 id="introduction">
    <title>Introduction by John Cox</title>

    <para><emphasis>Building a better mouse trap</emphasis> has always been a
    desire for inventors since the beginning of time.</para>

    <para>For the Xaraya team that was the motivation. Our desire and drive
    came from the idea of doing something that has not been done before, which
    in my opinion has been accomplished. Xaraya is the culmination of the work
    of several of the world's best software designers working within the PHP
    language at this time.</para>

    <para>The Official Xaraya Installation &amp; Getting Started Guide will
    introduce you to concepts that are, most likely, unfamiliar to you. Having
    complete control over the output of the software is the nirvana that most
    designers of Open Source Content Management Systems only dream of. Beyond
    the control of the output, though, is the control of the
    <emphasis>input</emphasis> as well, which to my knowledge has not been
    attempted.</para>

    <para>Xaraya will ask you to re-examine your expectations as to what
    Content Management Systems can -- <emphasis>and should</emphasis> -- offer
    you.</para>

    <para>The Official Xaraya Installation &amp; Getting Started Guide itself
    is the culmination of well over a year's worth of work to not only
    document what can be done, but to explain in common terms and phrases what
    Xaraya will do for you. It is not only the comprehensive guide to Xaraya,
    but it is a narrative which will walk you through the collective knowledge
    of the Xaraya team. The guide has been written by Drew Vogel (and others)
    who have likely spent more time documenting than others have spent
    coding.</para>

    <para>Welcome to the Official Xaraya Installation &amp; Getting Started
    Guide.</para>

    <para><emphasis>And welcome to Xaraya -- the next generation of Content
    Management Systems.</emphasis></para>

    <title>About this Guide</title>

    <para>This Guide will assist you with installing, configuring, running,
    and maintaining a Xaraya Community Site. It is intended for Xaraya
    installers or those individuals interested in Xaraya installation and
    configuration issues.</para>

    <para>This Guide is designed to be read from start to finish. Certain
    sections may be skipped (for example, if you're upgrading, you may not
    need to read the first-time installation instructions). However, reading
    this entire Guide from start to finish will provide the maximum
    educational benefit.</para>

    <para>Throughout the Guide, there are examples for you to follow. The
    examples add new features or illustrate concepts and are all designed to
    work together. Generally, the examples include Animals, Music, or Food but
    the concepts that they teach can be customized to your particular
    tastes.</para>

    <para>Throughout this Guide, we use several terms that you should
    understand. <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>"<firstterm>Anonymous users</firstterm>" are defined as users
          that have not registered/logged into an account on the site.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>"<firstterm>Registered users</firstterm>" are defined as users
          that have registered for an account on the site and have logged into
          the site with their username and password.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>"<firstterm>Site Administrators</firstterm>" are defined as
          one or more individuals who have administrative access to the site.
          Many sites have only one site administrator while some sites have an
          site administration team.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><firstterm>&lt;webdir&gt;</firstterm>: This is the local
          directory on your site from which pages are served by the webserver.
          For example, if you're using a modern Red Hat installation your
          &lt;webdir&gt; is usually /var/www/html. Consult your operating
          system manual for information on determining your
          &lt;webdir&gt;.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><firstterm>&lt;xarroot&gt;</firstterm>: This is the local
          directory on your site in which Xaraya is installed. If you choose
          to install your &lt;xarroot&gt; into your &lt;webdir&gt;, then the
          two terms have the same meaning -- they point to the same directory.
          However, if your &lt;webdir&gt; is /var/www/html, and you install
          Xaraya into a sub-directory called "xaraya", then your
          &lt;xarroot&gt; is /var/www/html/xaraya.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><firstterm>&lt;theme_dir&gt;</firstterm>: This is the local
          directory on your site in which Xaraya themes are stored. This
          directory location is defined in the Admin-&gt;Base-&gt;Modify
          config, Default Theme Directory field.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><firstterm>&lt;theme_name&gt;</firstterm>: This is the name of

          used as a stand-in for your site's URL. If you install Xaraya into a
          sub-directory of &lt;webdir&gt;, your site's URL will include the
          sub-directory. So, for example, if your &lt;webdir&gt; is
          /var/www/html, and you install Xaraya into a sub-directory called
          "xaraya", then your site's URL will be

    <para>Xaraya was written by the Xaraya Team. Xaraya is, as with many
    successful open-source projects, a huge collaborative effort relying on
    many talented contributors from across the globe. Without their vision,
    this document would not exist.</para>

    <para>This guide is built on version 0162 (Built 25-April-2004) of The

    <title>An Introduction to Content Management Systems</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>A glance toward the past...</title>

      <para>As the internet and world-wide web started to emerge as a major
      repository for storage, retrieval, and display of data, the main avenue
      for accessing that data was static, hand-coded,
      <firstterm>HTML</firstterm> (Hyper-Text Markup Language).
      <firstterm>Static HTML</firstterm> means that each and every web page on
      a site is created individually; links between content elements are
      managed by hand; and changes can be made only by a site administrator
      following a multiple-step process involving the downloading, editing,
      and uploading of new or modified pages.</para>

      <para>For users with moderate technical skills, the creation of web
      pages using static HTML is fairly easy. But because the
      <emphasis>content</emphasis> is not separated from the
      <emphasis>code</emphasis>, a lot of time is spent wrapping the content
      with HTML code so that it can be presented in a meaningful way.
      Composing pages in static HTML is time-intensive and can interfere with
      content; it's comparable to asking a book author to tackle typesetting,
      printing, and binding, which would certainly detract from the writer's
      primary goal: to provide content.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Challenges of developing and maintaining a static HTML
        website</title>

        <para>Without the separation of code and content, many aspects of
        managing a static HTML site are difficult. It is complicated to
        establish the 'look' of a site, and not easy to change that look once
        set. Searching for information on a site, even one with a limited
        number of pages, is an inaccurate, time-consuming task. It is
        impractical to collaborate on pages with colleagues unless additional
        administrative (FTP) accounts are configured or access codes are
        shared; both scenarios present a security risk.</para>

        <para>For many people, HTML editing programs like FrontPage and
        DreamWeaver present a better approach to website design,
        implementation, and maintenance. These programs offer tools for
        defining a site-wide 'look' using site templates, as well as
        additional features to make it easier to create and edit static HTML
        pages. However, even when using these tools, adding or modifying
        content still requires a combination of writing and coding, which can
        be tricky and time consuming difficult to accomplish for anyone with
        lower than moderate technical skills.</para>

        <para>For example typical publication cycle for a static HTML site
        might follow this pattern: An article is written; then passed to the
        web maintainer who creates a new page (following the site's design)
        either from a template or from scratch. The article is converted to
        HTML code and pasted into the new page; which, depending on the
        maintainer's workload may take several hours or more to be posted on
        the website. The new page is uploaded to the website and then manually
        linked to other pages as necessary, with related pages updated as
        necessary. That's a lot of time and a lot of work.</para>

        <para>In a limited number of contexts, static HTML may be quite
        suitable for a website. If the content on the site does not get
        updated frequently, is updated by a limited number of individuals,
        does not need to be searchable, does not require pleasant
        presentation, and if there is a technical individual who is willing to
        edit HTML and download &amp; upload changes, you may not need the
        advanced features of a Content Management System. However, before you
        put this book down and walk away, understand this: on the same
        hardware that runs your static HTML site, you can have a
        full-featured, easy-to-use Content Management System that makes
        updating content much easier and allows a huge variety of advanced
        features that simply were not available with static HTML sites.</para>

        <para>This represents a glance toward the past -- or maybe this is a
        look at the way you're currently doing things, and you have found
        yourself with too much data to manage effectively. But there is a
        better way. A way that will allow you create and present meaningful
        content on your website without downloading, coding, and uploading --
        from anywhere on the Internet. A way that will allow advanced features
        -- features like site-wide searches, user accounts, private messages,
        and much more -- features that are simply not possible with static
        HTML.</para>

        <para>A <firstterm>Content Management System</firstterm> could be the
        solution to your problems.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>...a step toward the future.</title>

      <para>The answer to all the wasted time and effort of maintaining static
      HTML websites is to use a Content Management System. Static HTML was
      insufficient for the management of content on even a modest website; it
      was clearly too much data and too much work. Though HTML editing tools
      streamlined the procedure for maintaining a static HTML site, a better
      method of data management was necessary.</para>

      <para>Web technology unveiled new competitive scenarios for companies:
      improved customer interaction, better business-to-business
      communication, and a more vibrant distribution of internal information.
      Today, many companies are turning to the web as a new playing field for
      innovation; tapping a wide variety of content and delivering it
      instantly to users around the globe. Some of the key goals of a Content
      Management System (CMS) are to provide users with personalized,
      transparent access to relevant information inside and outside of the
      organization; and to allow authors to easily contribute information to
      the knowledge base by managing content in a reliable, secure, and
      dependable way.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Dynamic Content Management as the way of the future</title>

        <para>Content Management Systems allow content to be handled and
        updated dynamically and makes it easy for non-technical people to
        create and modify content. What is 'dynamic content'? Dynamic content
        is content that may change frequently, is separated from the display
        (HTML) code, and is made into an 'element' that can be manipulated by
        the Content Management System. Dynamic content elements are usually
        stored in a database which is running the website.</para>

        <para>Good Content Management Systems are designed so that nearly
        anyone can publish, browse, and revise information without knowing
        much more than how to use a browser or a word processor. The technical
        details are hidden from site users, thus eliminating their need to
        learn about software programming, HTML, network protocols, or how and
        where to publish and retrieve files to work on them. With a click of a
        button, authorized users can contribute any content to areas of the
        site to which they have been granted access.</para>

        <para>Compared with static HTML, Content Management Systems:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Separate code from content making it easier to focus on
            content</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Offer a consistent, non-technical, easy-to-use interface for
            both users and administrators. Content contributors log into a
            secure area of the website, enter the date, title, and body of
            their news submission, and click submit, and the news article is
            published to the website with no hassle.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The entire look and feel of a website can be changed very
            easily. Some CMS packages even allow users to customize the way
            they see a website -- everything from language to colors to the
            on-screen placement of features.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Are feature-rich, and support additional, specialized
            features -- forums, galleries, live chat boards, private
            messaging, local weather, and more.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Are searchable because they rely on a database. This feature
            alone makes CMS an exceptional choice when compared to static
            HTML.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Allow for community involvement and collaboration. While
            CMS-based sites can be run effectively by one person, the
            community can easily comment on a website's content without
            requiring special access.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Gives administrators complete control over what each user or
            group of users can do within a web site. Administrators can
            control access to sections of a site, and assign user privileges
            and permissions to individuals or groups as we'll see in Chapter
            XX.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Once users have made the transition to a CMS, they will no
        longer feel incapacitated and unable to contribute to the website
        community. Often, the availability of all the new features provided by
        a CMS can be intimidating at first, and the learning curve can appear
        rather steep when compared to a static HTML page because while a
        static HTML page does not allow community involvement, CMS readily
        welcome it. CMS managed sites are simply so much easier to maintain
        than static HTML sites. To update a CMS site, all you need to do is
        surf to it and click on links to update the site. So, if you know how
        to surf the 'Net, you can maintain the site; very little other work is
        necessary!</para>

        <para>So far in this discussion, we have discussed only the most basic
        functions of a CMS, but there are hundreds of different functions
        available in an advanced Content Management System like Xaraya.
        Fortunately, it's fairly easy to learn the main functions, ignoring
        the rest of the features until you need to use them. This is another
        advantage of using a CMS instead of ordinary HTML pages: the advanced
        functionality allows users to search the site, post on forums, leave
        user information which is easily manageable -- in short, anything that
        can be done with advanced database management.</para>

        <para>A CMS implementation provides a win-win solution for business
        end-users, webmasters, and business management. It provides a complete
        environment that brings the power of distributed content management
        down to the average end-user, while at the same time addressing the
        most important requirements of the IT department, webmasters, and
        business management to provide a secure, fast, and effective portal;
        however commercial CMS packages (like Microsoft Content Management
        Server, Vignette, Stellent, and Obtree) can be prohibitively
        expensive. A quick internet search for commercial CMS packages reveals
        prices ranging from less than $99 through hundreds of thousands of
        dollars. Fortunately, there are several Open Source Software CMS
        solutions that cost very little or are completely free to use. Xaraya
        is a robust, free Content Management System that runs on all platforms
        that support the PHP scripting language, a web server, and a
        relational database management system (RDBMS).</para>

        <para>Open Source software is software which may be freely distributed
        and whose programming code is available and also modifiable by anyone,
        within the terms of a particular license.</para>

        <para>The basic idea behind Open Source Software is very simple: When
        programmers can study, redistribute, and modify the source code for a
        piece of software, that software evolves. People improve it, people
        adapt it, and people fix bugs. These modifications can be folded back
        into the development community, benefiting everyone. And this can
        happen at a speed that, if one is used to the slower pace of
        conventional software development, may seem astonishing.</para>

        <para>And you guessed it: the Xaraya Content Management System and all
        the pieces of software required to make it work are Open
        Source!</para>

        <para>In the next section we'll take a closer look at Xaraya and
        explore some of the many features that it has to offer.</para>

    <title>An Overview of Xaraya</title>

    <subtitle>A quick look at how Xaraya works.</subtitle>

    <para>Xaraya is a framework. It is not an out of the box solution, but
    merely an interface to let you do what you need.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>What are the basic building blocks of Xaraya? How do they
        interoperate?</para>

        <para>The Core (the files in the
        <filename>&lt;xarroot&gt;/includes</filename> directory) handles each
        page request. The core is the part that does all interaction with the
        database, it prepares conten for display and it lets the modules work.
        Modules provide units of functionality, and can be added, extended, or
        disabled as required. Some modules are mandatory, meaning that the
        core expects them to be available on the site. Other modules are
        optional and can be turned on or off as needed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>What is an Article?</para>

        <para>One of the first modules you will use is articles. Articles is
        one of the older modules that will let you publish content. Each block
        of content in Articles is called an article.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>What is a Publication Type?</para>

        <para>Publication Types are specific "types" of Articles on the site.
        A publication type is a set of rules for an Article. You can see it as
        a format, a template if you like. Examples of publication types are
        News Articles, Frequently Asked Questions, Pictures, or Recipes. You
        can see the overview of your publication types via
        <command>Admin-&gt;Articles-&gt;Pubtypes.</command></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>What is a Template?</para>

        <para>A Template is a file that defines how content items on the site
        are displayed (rendered). A Template receives output from a module and
        formats the output according to various rules. Templates can be very
        simple or very sophisticated. A normal page typically consists of many
        templates, each nested within another.</para>

        <para>Each module has a default set of templates that it uses, but
        templates can be over-ridden by creating a Theme. You can switch
        Themes at will, and each request for a particular page will check if
        there is an over-riding Template in the current Theme before using a
        default template.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>What is a Theme?</para>

        <para>Themes are a collection of templates, images, etc. that
        represent a particular Theme (layout, style, or skin) for your site.
        Typically, you would have at least the page templates in the Theme
        directory, and possibly some overrides for default module and block
        templates.</para>

        <para>Special themes include the "print" theme, where the page
        template does not include any blocks and so will only show the output
        of the main module function, and the "rss" theme, that doesn't
        generate XHTML at all but XML for syndication by other sites.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Are Articles, Publication Types, and Templates related? If so,
        how?</para>

        <para>Each Publication Type uses a specific template to display
        content of a particular type. This means each Publication Type can
        have a different layout or format.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>How are Articles sorted into Sections/Categories/Topics?</para>

        <para>Articles can be placed into Categories (one or more). The
        Categories may mean different things from site to site, depending on
        how they were configured. The default Xaraya installation of the
        Articles module contains a set of Categories familiar to
        administrators of other Open Source CMS products (PHP-Nuke, PostNuke,
        Envolution, etc.) where news articles are categorised in two
        independent ways (Topics &amp; Categories) and documents are
        categoriesed into Sections.</para>

        <para>New Xaraya sites will often use generic categories across all
        Publication Types, instead of having separate hierarchies for each of
        them. See overview on <command>Admin-&gt;Articles</command> for more
        information.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>How, and by what, are Articles displayed?</para>

        <para>Articles are displayed by the Articles module, in cooperation
        with a bunch of 'hooked' utility modules (categories, hitcount,
        ratings, comments, and other modules). The way an article is displayed
        depends on the settings in the publication type and the formatting in
        the template.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>What do Categories do? Are they the only way of sorting
        Articles, or are they just an example?</para>

        <para>You can organize your Categories however you see fit -- the
        Categories provided at installation are just an example which may be
        modified, extended, or completely removed as you require.</para>

        <para>Articles can be browsed by Publication Type, by Category, and/or
        by Author, and sort the results by date, title, and other
        criteria.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Do Articles need to be sorted into a simple hierarchy or can
        they be sorted into a multidimensional array with each Article fitting
        into several independent hierarchies simultaneously or using category
        flags instead of a hierarchy at all?</para>

        <para>Each "base category" is organised as a hierarchy, but several
        independent base categories (and their hierarchies) can be assigned to
        each of the Publication Types in Articles.</para>

        <para>For instance, a travel site might have one hierarchy with
        countries and cities, and another hierarchy with particular interests
        (for example, culture, sports, restaurants, etc.). An Article about a
        restaurant in Brussels can, for example, be placed in the category
        "Brussels" and <emphasis>also</emphasis> in the category
        "Restaurants", and people can then view all articles about Brussels,
        about restaurants, or about restaurants in Brussels.</para>

        <para>And if you work by Publication Type, you could let people browse
        only through reviews (a particular Publication Type) about restaurants
        in Brussels.</para>

    <title>What does Xaraya mean?</title>

    <para>The name <firstterm>Xaraya</firstterm> was selected by the
    development team after an internal contest. Submitted by Marty Vance
    (Dracos), Xaraya does not really mean anything. We were looking for a name
    which was both interesting and unique. Xaraya certainly fit the
    bill.</para>

    <para>That said, the word Xaraya is reminiscent of
    '<foreignphrase>raya</foreignphrase>', the Spanish word for Manta Ray. The
    development team rather likes the nautical feel of that reference,
    particularly when one thinks of the Internet as an "ocean" of information.
