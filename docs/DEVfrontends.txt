Notes on different frontends and their capabilities.


Requirements for a front end (js) library
-----------------------------------------
- widget (or controls) is our immediate direct need to lighten the
  burden on template/theme maintenance
- having events on the controls to asynchronously load other data is
  the second need (master detail relations, repopulation combo's etc.)
- specifying the controls should be a 3 step process maximal:
  1. include on js entry point for the request
  2. write the controls inside a xar-template
  3. (optional) customize the default behaviour to the applications need.

Whether the tags used are compiled/transformed on the server or
through a js callback is irrelevant for us.

UPDATE: there was a statement earlier we adopted jquery as our standard?
