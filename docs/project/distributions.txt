Second proposal, taking the repository discussion into account:

1. Core distribution
====================
Goal: Minimal distribution for framework 
----------------------------------------
adminpanels
authsystem
base
blocks
dynamicdata
installer
mail
modules
privileges
roles
sniffer
themes

2. Classic distribution (or base distribution)
==============================================
Goal: basic distribution to set up a 'typical portal'
-----------------------------------------------------
Contains core plus:
articles
authldap
autolinks
bloggerapi
categories
comments
dyn_example
ephemerids
example
headlines
hitcount
html
messages
polls
quotes
ratings
recommend
referer
search
stats
translations
wiki
xmlrpcserver
xmlrpcsystemapi
xmlrpcvalidatorapi

3. Full distribution
====================
Goal: Distribution of all 'working' modules, to be decided by PMC.
Contains core
Contains classic plus:
addressbook
bbclick
bbcode
bkview
calendar
cast
censor
changelog
contact
figlet
mybookmarks
opentracker
pubsub
release
smilies
uploads
xarbb
xslt


4. Language packs
=================
Language packs are distributed separately. All other distributions 
are based on the english language with two locales: en_US.iso8859-1 
and en_US.utf-8.

5. Theme packs
==============
Theme packs are distributed separately. All other distribution are 
based on Xaraya_Classic theme.


Modules which are not in 'working' condition, by my poor judgement 
(it can mean both 'unknown' and 'not working')
and thus are not registered for any distribution yet. Please prove 
me wrong if your module is listed and you want to have it included 
in one of the distributions.
