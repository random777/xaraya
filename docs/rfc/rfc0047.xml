                This RFC documents the trackback functionality in xaraya. Trackback has had
                lots of attention by the growth of blogging lately. The principle of trackback
                can however be applied to other content than just weblogs pretty easily. A 
                thorough understanding of what trackback is and how it should be used is 
                necessary though. This RFC serves two goals:

            <t>
                As blogging has become very popular (quick search for
                estimate: between 2.4 and 2.9 million webloggers), it's time to 
                have xaraya be a good backend for blogging.
            </t>
            <t>
                An important part of blogging is the so-called trackback
                facility. In short it can be described as linking the weblogs
                together in a special way to created an <em>interlinked</em> space
                of the weblog entries. It appears that the concept of trackback creates
                some confusion, so we do an attempt to explain it here in simple
                terms and describe how the concept applies to Xaraya.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document is largely based on the specification located 
                here <xref target="refs.1"/>. MT is one of the most widely
                used blogging systems and their implementation is leading for
                most client developers.
            </t>
            
            <section title="What is trackback?">
                <t>
                    From the MT website:
                    <artwork>
                In a nutshell, TrackBack was designed to provide a
                method of notification between websites: it is a
                method of person A saying to person B, "This is
                something you may be interested in." To do that,
                person A sends a TrackBack ping to person B.
                    </artwork>
                </t>
                <t>
                    How does this work in real life? It's convenient
                    to view at it from two distinct goals:
                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t>content aggregation: having one place to read about one topic</t>
                        <t>remote comments: comments on something published elsewhere</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                    The first can be translated into sending a
                    notification the the <em>one place</em> that
                    something is published on a certain topic. The
                    central place functions as the place where this
                    type of content is aggregated. The publisher sends
                    a notification to the central place, stating that
                    something was published. The central place records
                    enough information about the publication so it can
                    be "tracked back"
                </t>
                <t>
                    The second is more pro-active. Someone reads an
                    interesting publication and wants to write a
                    comment about it, or just write something
                    related. Instead of commenting on the site where
                    the publication is, he comments on his own weblog
                    (because it <em>fits</em> his own list of subjects
                    for example. After publishing the comment or the
                    related publication a ping is send to the original
                    location, so the comment can be "tracked back"
                    from that location to the location where the
                    remote comment is.
                </t>

        <section title="Requirements List">
            <t>
                The main objective of this API is to allow a Trackback enabled site to send Trackback pings
                and recieve them. Then the system must route them to the appropriate Xaraya content item.
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>Send Trackback Pings</t>
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>Trackback module send out the Trackback ping</t>
                        <t>Pings are triggered by:</t>

                    <t>Receive Trackback Pings</t>
                    <t>
                        When items on other sites change or are created as a
                        trackback to a xaraya item a trackback ping is received
                        This ping needs to be handled by xaraya and stored in relation
                        to the item remotely referenced.
                    </t>
                    <list>

                        <t>Route information (based on URL) to the right module and store the info there</t>

                            Make xaraya retrieve trackback urls
                            ===================================
                            When creating a new item, the trackback module should offer the 
                            possibility to retrieve trackback info from an url. This can be both
                            manually or automatically 

                            example in javascript:
                            window.open('http://your.xaraya.com/ws.php?type=trackback&amp;url=currenturl');


                            Xaraya trackback module can then inspect /currenturl/ and extract the entries on which
                            trackback should refer to.
