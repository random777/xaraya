1. How do I jump to a certain point, do some coding and merge this back into the main tree?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose changeset 1.156 is in the past and you want to fix things from there.

a.) bk clone -r1.156 ~/bk/main ~/bk/bugfix
This will get you a repository as it was during changeset 1.156 in the bugfix directory

b.) cd ~/bk/bugfix
   
c.) hack hack hack

[time passes, main is ready for bugfix]
   
d.) cd ~/bk/main

e.) bk pull ../bugfix
Get only the bugfixes back into your local main tree. Any conflicts can be resolved now
If you've cloned your main tree from a central one, a bk push will send the bugfix over to
that repository as well

Remarks:
	- why not use clone -l ?


2. How can I see what will be send out/in if i do bk push/pull?
---------------------------------------------------------------

bk changes -L  (list changes which are only in local an not in remote)
bk changes -R  (list changes which are only in remote and not in local)

3. I'm on windows and I can't clone, something with rsh not found. What do I do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems that in the cygwin install, ssh and friends are not included. Here's what 
you can do.
1. Get the webinstaller for cygwin from cygwin.com
2. Fire it up and look for the openssh and openssl package, install them both
3. try it again

4. I'm looking for changesets with revtool, the dates and times are all wrong, what's happening?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because developer groups can consist of people in different timezone all date and timestamps are
in UTC time. 

5. I'm a scenario lead and have my own repository for the big change I'm making. I want the 'catch-up'
   with the main tree. How do I do that?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The scenario tree you are working in is a child of the actual scenario tree and has a different (higher)
level. For getting changes into the scenario (for example, just before finishing up the scenario and 
putting it up for review) do the following:

a.) bk parent yourname@xaraya.com:/path/to/main-tree
This will set your parent to the main repository
b.) bk pull
This will get the changes from the main tree which you don't have and apply them.
c.) bk parent yourname@xaraya.com:/path/to/scenario-tree

Or perhaps easier:

bk pull yourname@xaraya.com:/path/to/main-tree

This will do all of the above in one go. The parent is only changed for this command.

6. I'm getting errors on pull that files are in the changeset but not in the repository. What does it
   mean and what can I do to make it go away.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It means that you are pulling files with changes in them but your local copy doesn't have the file 
while it should have a copy. This can be caused by a number of problems, one of which is a bitkeeper
bug (identified on windows version 3.0). Contact you local bitkeeper guru to help you out.

7. When I pull I get the error: 
   path/to/some/file/SCCS/s.somefile.php is edited and modified; unsafe to overwrite. What does that mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This message is a little bit confusing. The file somefile.php is in /path/to/somefile/ and is checked out 
from the repository and modified. Run bk citool to check this file in and then pull again. For a pull to 
automatically resolve differences between the remote repository and your local one, all files need to be
checked in, so bitkeeper knows what changes have been made.
