            This means we feel our functionality is complete, our core 
            features are mature and the use of the modules in our repositories is 
            stable enough to start the last mile:
            <strong>The road to Xaraya 1.0!</strong>
        </xar:mlstring>
    </p>
    <p>
        <xar:mlstring>
            This last mile is an important stretch. No major changes to the codebase
            in terms of functionality will land, but there are a couple of bugs left we
            really would like to see fixed before we release Xaraya 1.0 as a result
            of almost 3 years of work.

            For this, more than ever, we need you to keep filing  any 
            unexpected functionality in our <a href="http://bugs.xaraya.com">bug tracker
            </a>.

        The following template is just an example of how more static templates 
        can be added to an already static page (the default front page in this case). 
        This question pops up in irc, so people are sometimes unaware of these
        possibilities.. One possibility is to place a static template on the
        same level (or in a subdirectory) as the 'container' template (this one)
        and then insert it with xar:template tag as a system template (with optional wrapper div here):
    </xar:comment>
    <div class="xar-floatright xar-halfwidth xar-margin-thicksides xar-padding-thick xar-mod-body xar-alt xar-sub">
        <xar:template file="glimpse.xt" type="system" />
    </div>
    <xar:comment>
        Another easy way is to specify a static template as an extra page template of base module:
    </xar:comment>
    <xar:module main="false" module="base" func="main" page="about" />
</div>
