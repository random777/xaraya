		This design is for user data that can be assigned to groups,
        with optional selection lists for fields, i.e. for dropdowns.

          <t>
	This design attempts to merge Dynamic Data, Dynamic User Data and Module
        Variables. Values are serialized to support transparent storage of complex
        types (arrays etc). Each type has a default BL tag for rendering, which can
        be overwritten in the property. Properties are referenced by module name.

      <t>
      Dynamic Data will use two sets of APIs. Creation and Deletion of of variables is done within
      a module, while reading and writing variable contents is done in the core.

      There are currently discussions whether to combine Dynamic User Data with generalized
      Dynamic Data, in essence abstracting away the relationship between users and dynamic
      data, and allowing every module to define its own dynamic data. This brings up the question
      if module variables are being reinvented, and what should happen with the functionality
      to assign responsibility for storing user variables to authentication modules. 

      The current core API functions are:

    <section title="Relationship to other areas">
      <t>It will need to be determined if it makes sense to allow storage of certain properties
      via the modular authentication system. For instance, it could be beneficial to store
      dynamic properties for the users module in LDAP. Also, it needs to be determined how and
      if dynamic properties integrate with the Multilangue system. Marco has some thoughts about
      this, i hope he will share them soon. Property validation should be done by using the
      facilties provided by xarVarValidate.</t>
