RFC-17 Module Information System 


 Postnuke                                                              Gary Mitchell
 RFC-17 Module Information System
 Category: Informational                                               May 2002
 Version: 0.1
1. Introduction 
This paper presents a vision of an integrated Module Information System. This system would allow: 
A central repository to store module information. 
Developers to announce new modules, upgrades or new versions. 
Allow the Postnuke staff a place to manage module attributes (status, test results, security review, etc). 
A RSS Feed to list new module announcements 
Tools so a Postnuke Admin can check for new or updates modules for their site. 
2. Module Information Repository 
Today, information about what Postnuke modules are available is widely dispersed. Users have difficulty finding available modules, updates and support. 
We're going solve that problem by creating a Central Module Repository (database). The repository will reside on postnuke.com and provide the following functionality: 
Provide a place for module developers to announce new or updated modules. 
Assigns an unique module ID and prevent duplicate module names. 
Allows the developer to announce new versions of a module, Postnuke version supported, and the download location for that version. 
Query the develop on a number of questions related on the module (security, etc). 
Allow the Quality staff to record information about the module version such as: 
Documentation - Does the module come with quality installation and usage documentation 
Installation - Did the module install cleanly and were core changes required 
Quality - Is there any obvious bugs in the module or installation 
Security - ensure the module uses the API security functions and check 777 access requirements 
Standards compliance - ensure the module meets current ADODB, pnAPI, pnMDG, and other standards. 
Module Status - Official, Beta, Alpha, Non-standard 
Use the Comments API to provide a place to discussion and support of each module. 
Use the Ratings/Rankings API to give the everyone a place to Rate a module. (optional) 
3. RSS Feed 
Module announcements will be made available on an RSS feed. 
4. Site Administration Functions 
Additional functionality will be added to the Postnuke code to allow the site admin to query the modules repository for updates to modules installed on their site. The query would be done via XML or MySQL dababase call. The admin will be provided a link to download updated modules (to avoid 777 permission problems).
