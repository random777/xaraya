PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS UPGRADE.txt BEFORE UPGRADING OR USING AN EXISTING Xaraya installation

If you have existing Xaraya sites, please check the VERSION CHANGES at the end of this file in case you need to update themes, templates or other areas in existing sites.

If you are creating a new Xaraya installation, please ensure you read INSTALL.txt


You are Upgrading to Xaraya: adam_baum 1.0.2
============================================
Xaraya is an Open Source web applications framework.  Xaraya started out as a fork of PostNuke (http://www.postnuke.com). It has had a complete re-write from the ground up since it's beginnings.  Xaraya provides significant enhancements and functionality over it's predecessors and is in active, on-going development. Xaraya provides a stable and secure core, with a function rich API and powerful templating engine in place for third-party developers.

If you would like to help develop this software, please visit our homepage at http://www.Xaraya.com, or send email to info@xaraya.com .

You can also visit us in channel #support or #chat, on our IRC Server irc.Xaraya.com.

PREPARE TO UPGRADE
==================
    * Backup the old Xaraya installation & database

    * Log in to your existing Xaraya site with administration rights.

    * Ensure you protect any custom content or themes you have in
      - <xarroot>/var/ subdirectories
      - <xarroot>/themes/
      Be sure to check the upgrade changes between versions (see below)
      to ensure you update any custom templates if needed

    * Make a backup 

    * Replace all existing Xaraya files, directories, and modules
      with the new Xaraya files EXCEPT:
       -  <xarroot>/var/config.system.php
       -  files below the var directory which may contain data from your site
        (typically for uploads, workflow processes, images etc)

    * Make a backup (yes, we know this was already mentioned two times)

    * With "replacing" we mean DELETE all old files and copy the new ones in.
      Do not overwrite the old files with the new ones. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

     The existing <xarroot>/var/config.system.php must be retained;
     the upgrade script reads database settings from this file.

    * Check permissions and ownership of the new files

    * Make sure you have cleared all your cache files in
      <xarroot>/var/cache/templates and <xarroot>/var/cache/rss

    * In browser window where you are logged in as administrator,
       point your browser to upgrade.php in your root directory.
       For example, http://www.mywebsite.com/upgrade.php.

    * Carefull read and follow the instructions in the upgrade script.

    * After the upgrade has completed, remove upgrade.php and install.php
      from your web directory

    * Ensure that <xarroot>/var/config.system.php has appropriate permissions.
      for security, and is read only

    * Go to Admin->Modules->View All.
      Upgrade all required modules that are show the status of UPGRADE.
      Remember to Activate them after upgrade if required.

    * Clear your xarcachemanager output cache files, if you use xarcachemanager

Check the COMMON UPGRADE PROBLEMS at the end of this file if you are
experiencing upgrade difficulties.

Adding a locale (language and encoding):
---------------------------------------
- If you wish to add an additional locale for your Xaraya installation,
  download your preferred locale from http://www.xaraya.com/downloads/languages.
  For example: es_ES.utf8

- Unpack the new locale to the Xaraya directory at var/locales

  NOTE: If you have var/locales/es_ES.utf8 directory
        already present after installation, delete it!
        It only contains installer translations.

- Create the directory var/locales/es_ES.utf8/php

- Make this directory writeable for the web server process

- Set the site encoding to es_ES.utf8 in the
  Base - Modify Config - Languages and Locales - Default Locale setting.

- If you need an additional locale with an encoding different
  from UTF-8 please read this document
  http://www.xaraya.com/index.php/documentation/539

- If you had translations files in utf-8 format you need
  to copy translations files for your theme and modules to the new locale,
  else you should connect to our support for help with
  converting it to XML format.
  We store translations in XML format with UTF-8 encoding only.


Please visit the #support channel for information on converting to Xaraya from CMS applications such as PostNuke or PHP-Nuke.


VERSION CHANGES - Please check and update your installation where necessary
===============

   ----------------------------------------------------
   .9.10.0 -> .9.11.0 
          modules/xarbb/xartemplates/user-newreply.xd : the input form

       1) in articles, fields of type Calendar (other than pubdate) are

          formats xarLocaleFormatDate('...',$myfield) in those templates

Common Upgrade Problems
==========================

* If you are getting errors after upgrade, clear your template 
   and rss cache files (and adodb if relevant). 
  Clear your xarcachemanager output cache if you have the module installed.

* If you are having difficulty accessing a module, check to see if it
   needs upgrading, and also ensure it is activated if required
   
* If you are using a default theme, ensure it is active and also 
  does not need upgrading.

* The <xarroot>var/cache/rss and <xarroot>/var/cache/templates directories 
  need to be writable and executable
