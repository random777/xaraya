    <title>What can you expect from Xaraya and this Guide?</title>

    <para>Xaraya is a flexible package that provides the requisite framework
    to create content management solutions and web applications for small,
    medium and large scale installations alike. Xaraya is currently used to
    develop blogs, community portals, content management solution (CMS) for
    SMEs, corporate intranet and multisite web solutions, and specialist
    industry solutions such as applications in e-commerce, finance, education,
    scientific, or medical areas.</para>

    <para>One of the inherent problems that often accompanies the flexibility
    demonstrated by Xaraya, is a perception of complexity. This Developer
    Guide aims to reduce that perception of complexity. The Guide does this by
    illustrating how easily it can be to understand the components that make
    up Xaraya, and how they can be programatically combined to deliver the
    functionality you need to create your web application.</para>

    <para>This Developer Guide provides the reader with: </para>

        together to deliver web functionality</para>

    <title>What do you need to know?</title>

    <para>To best use this Xaraya Developer Guide some assumptions in
    background knowledge are made. In particular this Guide is not a training
    manual on PHP, XHTML or popular databases such as MySQL , postgreSQL and
    SQLite and assumes some familiarity with them at least.</para>

    <para>In order to develop with Xaraya, you will need to have an
    appreciation of the following general Xaraya concepts:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Overview of how Xaraya core functionality works and delivers
        pages to your web site</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Identify key Xaraya components such as modules, blocks, and
        hooks; their structure; and how they work together to provide
        functionality in your web application</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>How you can use Xaraya's templating system, Blocklayout, to
        manipulate data from Xaraya function output and use it to deliver
        content to users</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following chapter in this Guide begins this exploratory
    journey.</para>

    <para>The second part of this Guide, Extending Xaraya using modules,
    provides a detailed and practical look at how you can start working with
    Xaraya.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Writing a module for Xaraya can be an adventure, a glorious event
    when finished, but a long yourney in between. This guide will help to easy
    the process, as in its roots, it is a very simple one.</para>

    <section>
      <title>What is a module</title>

      <para>Xaraya itself can be seen as an operating system. The Core
      download shows the core operation files. The Xaraya system allows for
      expansion of its functionality using modules. A module is a set of files
      containing functions with predefined names and roles that integrate very
      easily with a standard deployment of Xaraya. A module can also include
      blocks, images, plain HTML files etc. A module provides a specific
      functionality like "enable users to post comments to articles" for the
      comments module.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Why write a module?</title>

      <para>There are a number of reasons to write a module. The main reason
      is that Xaraya does not provide a specific function that you would like.
      However, first make sure there aren't easier ways to get where you want
      to get. Nobody wants to spend time on things that others have already
      created or thought about. Have a look at these questions here:
      <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Can't you get the job done with extending an existing
            module?</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Can't you make use of Dynamic Data in an existing
            module?</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Isn't the thing you want just a matter of adjusting the
            templates for pages, thus creating your own theme and showing data
            from the database in your own way? If you don't like the order of
            items, or want other terms, then make your own theme and adjust
            the templates within the modules.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the adjustment a matter of changing the words in an
            existing module? You can change all wording by adding your own
            'translation' using the translations module?</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>If you still cannot make want you want using the
      suggestions here, then it is time to read on and create your own
      module!</para>

      <title>Related Documents</title>

      <para>The main reference you should look at is the 'Example Module'.
      This module is an annotated reference for current best practise. It is
      regularly maintained by Xaraya developers and shows how to setup a
      module. It can perfectly serve as a start for your own module. You can
      get a full copy of the example module from the full download/extensions
      download or from the Xaraya monotone repository.</para>

      <title>Suggestions and Updates</title>

      <para>The Xaraya module system is a work-in-progress. There are no doubt
      many good ideas out there that have not been incorporated into the
      Xaraya module system, and if a developer has a request for a particular
      set of functionality then they can submit it to the Xaraya features
      request list at the Xaraya Bugzilla website: <ulink
      url="http://bugs.xaraya.com">http://bugs.xaraya.com</ulink></para>

      <para>If you have found a bug within the current module system then you
      can submit it to the bug list at the same address. Please note that the
      main requirement for the Xaraya module design is stability. Due to this,
      it is possible that your request for new or updated functionality will
      be refused because it is too specific, can easily be built from core API
      functions, or carries out work that should rightly be done by a module.
      In such situations, the Xaraya team will always try to provide a simple
      alternative, but please remember that submission of a new or updated
      addition to the module design does not guarantee inclusion.</para>
