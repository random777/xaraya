        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
            The Roles module lets you create and manage roles on your Xaraya site. Roles are
            representations of the site's registered users and the different groups they can belong to. The Roles module is a core module within Xaraya and cannot be removed. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Roles can be members of other roles, to any degree. You can, for instance, use
            roles to represent a company's organization chart, or the set of classes at a
            university. A role can be a member of as many other roles as you like (as long as the
            parents are groups).</li>
            <li>Roles can be assigned privileges. By doing so, you define what a given role may or
            may not do on the site. You can use the test functionality of the Roles module to see
            what parts of the site a role with a given set of privileges has access to.</li>
            <li>Roles have inheritance. A role inherits all the privileges of all of its parents,
            but can override them. If you give a group editing privileges, for instance, any other
            role that is a member of that group inherits the editing privileges. If you want to
            restrict the privileges of some of the members, simply assign them a different set of
            privileges (say reading), and the privileges of the parent will be overridden.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to use it?</h2>
        <h3>Menu Options</h3>
        <p>
            As an administrator, you can change the module's configuration by pointing your browser to the configuration page <strong>Admin Menu &#8594; Roles &#8594; Modify Configuration</strong>. The configuration page includes the standard display options common to all core modules (see the Base module overview for an explanation of these).
        </p>
        <p>The roles module provides key functions to manage the users and groups on your site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>View Groups/users</strong>: a tabbed interface to user and roles listings with
            a variety of display options. You can also add users from this view, delete or modify
            users, email groups of users, test their privileges, and view users by various sorting
            and selection criteria.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Add Group/User</strong>: A form for creation of a new user or group. If you
            have hooked Dynamic Data to Roles and created extra properties for your users, these
            will also be displayed here.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Email Messaging</strong>: Configure email notifications to users on
            registration, change of passwords, and account activation including template
            customization. You can also email groups of users from this view.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Recall/Purge</strong>: Users or groups that have been deleted can be recalled
            from this screen or purged for good from the system.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Site Lock</strong>: Lock your site to registration or login during maintenance
            or updates.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Modify Config</strong>: Set general site options including: 
                <ul>
                <li>designated site Administrator and default registration User group</li>
                <li>default Authentication and Registration module</li>
                <li>activation of user variables and Dynamic Data for roles such as Last Login,
                User Home, Last Password Update, Timezone</li>
                <li>Role Member Account Options related to User Home, editing of Member Account,
                and search by Email</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Default Roles</h3>
        <p>The roles on your site are arranged in a tree. At the top of the tree is a role called
        Everybody, which represents the "group of all groups" on your site. Every user and every
        group is a member or descendent of Everybody.</p>
        <p>Xaraya also comes preconfigured with a minimal set of roles that are loaded when you run
        the installer. This configuration is shown below:</p>
        <pre>
            Everybody
            |
            |---Anonymous
            |
            |---Administrators
            |   |
            |   |---Admin
            |
            |---Users

    </pre>
        <p>At installation time you are asked to choose a configuration that affects preinstalled
        privileges assigned to the above roles. The privileges can be changed after installation.
        The default roles and minimum privileges at installation time are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Everybody</strong>: the role containing all other roles. This role has no
            access privileges.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Anonymous</strong>: a user that represents any unregistered users on your site.
            This role is initially configured with privileges only to access the front page of the
            site and the login block.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Administrators</strong>: a group that has administration privileges.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Admin</strong>: a member of Administrators. This is the Admin role you create
            with the Xaraya installer.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Users</strong>: a group that normally holds registered users of the site. N.B.:
            this role does not come preconfigured with any privileges. 
            <em>Its members will not have access to the site until you assign some
            privileges.</em></li>
            <li>
            <strong>Myself</strong>: this is a special role that enables you to assign privileges
            that will be applied to the current user's content. For example if you assign edit
            privileges for articles to the Myself role, then users will be able to edit only their
            own articles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preconfigured roles cannot be changed or removed. You can, however, add members to
        them. You can also define as many more roles in the tree as you wish in whatever
        configuration you choose.</p>
        <p>Always keep in mind: When you create a role, until you've assigned it some privileges,
        it will only have those privileges it inherits from its parents.</p>
        <h3>Extending Roles</h3>
        <p>You can extend roles by hooking in the functionality of other modules to roles or adding
        fields directly to the user object via the admin interface in dynamicdata</p>
