<p style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to the xaraya development roadmap. This document briefly
describes
where the xaraya project has been, and then details where it is going.
It
proposes key "road rules" and a release schedule for ongoing xaraya
source milestone releases, from which anyone can build commercial and
other
products. It also hints at how xaraya-the-platform should evolve,
again from
an operational or "release process" point of view.
<!--

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a name="background">Background</a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The <a href="http://docs.xaraya.com/docs/roadmap.php">original roadmap</a>
recorded
the active tasks and their developers into considerable detail. It
turned out to be impossible to maintain that detailed roadmap. With
hindsight, most of the tasks depicted in that roadmap to 1.0 have now
been completed. Theoretically we're halfway between 1.1 and 1.2 at this
point.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This</span>
roadmap pinpoints the switch
from 4 digit releases to 3 digit
releases; this can loosely be interpreted as the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">R</span>elease <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>andidate turning point. <br>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This means that the rules for changes
will be more strict starting with
<span style="font-weight: bold;">milestone 0.9.7</span>. The repository
receiving the changes will be open for
developers for a relatively short period of time allowing changes
without direct approval. After that period, the repository will be
closed for any changes and all patches will be reviewed. (The above is
valid for our main line of development. With bitkeeper it is possible
to keep working in your own scenarios for other work. If you think this
situation applies to you, and you need advice on how to set up those
scenarios with bitkeeper, contact <a href="mailto:marcel@xaraya.com">me</a>.)<br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a name="tree-management">Scenario
management</a></h2>
<p>
Here is a depiction of the latest thinking on scenario management:
</p>
<center><img style="border: 0pt none ; width: 700px; height: 270px;"
 src="roadmap.png" alt="Tree Management Diagram"></center>
<div style="margin-left: 160px;"><small><small>Diagram by Rolf Meiier, <a
 href="http://www.karu.nl">Studio Karu</a></small></small><br>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each RC period lasts for about 3 weeks
in total. The RC period starts
with an open period in which normal check-in rules apply, albeit only
for changes which are necessary to realize the milestone. <br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through the period the
repository will be closed for automatic
changes and be managed by the PMC for a duration of about 10 days.. All
changes pushed will be reviewed and, if applicable to the milestone,
applied to the repository. During this period, non relevant changes wil
not be applied. The repositories will obviously still be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pullable</span> so everyone involved can
continue testing.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After this restricted period a
milestone release will be built and
the repository will be opened up again, starting the next RC period. It
is expected that the period from milestone 0.9.9 to release 1.0 will
take slightly longer, partly because we want to make sure everything is
very
solid in the 1.0 release, but also because the repository will be
branched to a 1.0 maintenance tree. (or put into a scenario, in our own
terminology)<br>
</p>
<p>During this whole release trajectory the <a
 href="http://bugs.xaraya.com">xaraya bug tracking
system</a> plays a crucial role. The registration of the info in
bugzilla
should be a reflection of what was written in the <a
 href="http://www.xaraya.com/index.php/docs/580">Xaraya 1.0 manifesto</a>
published earlier. Most of the decisions for applying or holding
patches
will be based on the manifesto combined with the information available
in bugzilla. It is therefore, now more than ever, crucial that the
information in bugzilla is correct, verbose and up to date to be able
to make the right decisions.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus we hope to match the rhythm of
the xaraya community, which
seems to have
resulted in an odd-even pattern of "alpha-ness" and "beta-ness"
observed since
at least xaraya 0.9.0.5.&nbsp;
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we are rationalizing our
release numbering to 3 digits, to
mark the countdown to 1.0, logically substracting another digit from
the version number at 1.0 release time. After that point the 1.0.x
branch (scenario) will appear to hold fixes to the 1.0 line while more
aggressive development continues in the main repository. The long-lived
1.0.x branch should host conservative development of bug
fixes
that may also be appropriate for the main repository,
per the xaraya 1.0 manifesto's

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The milestone freeze will be announced on the developer lists ahead of
time, so people know when to expect it.
During the freeze, only bugs deemed "must-fix-for-this-milestone",
typically
last minute regressions, are fixed in the repository, as everyone tries
to
qualify
the continuing pulls as release-worthy,
leading to a release at the earliest 10 days after the freeze. If
deemed necessary, a short-lived scenario can be created for the RC
releases (one of the advantages of BitKeeper, is that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">branching</span> is very cheap); at this
time, we dont expect this to happen as the release is created from a
freezed scenario to start with. One situation when the scenario might
be
necessary is when one or two particularly nasty bugs need to be fixed
in the milestone and we do not want the main line to wait for them to
be fixed, so the delay will not directly affect the next milestone.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have tried, and sometimes failed, to
avoid slipping any release
and to
avoid extending the life of a milestone scenario.
In spite of the past, we aim to release 10 days after the freeze. So,
any not-quite-showstopper bugs unfixed by that time should be
targeted at
the next xaraya milestone and fixed ASAP.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are planning a xaraya-based
product release whose schedule does
not
jibe well with the above milestones, we welcome your
<a href="mailto:xaraya_pmc@xaraya.com">feedback</a> (we will keep
confidential
information to ourselves, making the proper arrangements, so your
schedule can run independantly of ours, while remaining integratability
(this requires a bitkeeper installation at your end))<br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a name="how-you-can-help">How you can
help</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Xaraya developers</b>: we need your input to Bugzilla, marking bugs
with <tt>performance</tt>, <tt>security</tt>, <tt>blcdesign</tt>,
<tt>xaraya1.0 </tt>and other relevant
keywords. <a href="#project-management">xaraya project management</a>
will help
ensure
that bugs are assigned to developers who can target their fixes so as
to
satisfy
as many milestone-keyword nominations as possible.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bug assignees</b>, and especially
helpers who can offload <tt>Future</tt>d
or untargeted bugs from their nominal assignees and fix those bugs:
please make
a pass at targeting your assigned bugs across the <tt>xaraya1.1</tt>
and <tt>xaraya1.2</tt> milestones, using the criteria in the xaraya
1.0
manifesto.
Please try to offload bugs to helpers, pinging <a
 href="mailto:xaraya_pmc@lists.xaraya.com">xaraya_pmc@xaraya.com</a> if
you
cannot find
anyone to help fix futured or untargeted bugs that you believe should
be fixed
soon.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Community members</b>: please use
the <tt>xaraya1.</tt><i>x</i>
milestone-keyword
nomination system wisely, and do not change the Target Milestone of
anyone
else's bug without the assignee's consent.
The keyword-proposal/target-milestone-disposal system will continue
beyond 1.0
to help inform prioritization by bug assignees. Also, please keep
advocacy out of the bug
system.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a name="project-management">Project
management</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Xaraya.com has a project management team to coordinate the process
described above.&nbsp; Amongst other things they will focus in this
phase on:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>drive developers wanting to help out toward bugs which need
fixing in a
timely
fashion;</li>
  <li>moderate risk of the project</li>
  <li>aid commercial projects based on
xaraya in
managing their product releases</li>
  <li>building a team structure with team leads in the different key
areas of the product suite</li>
</ul>
We are currently <a
 href="http://www.xaraya.com/index.php?module=roles&amp;func=viewtree&amp;uid=948">configuring
our own roles module</a> on www.xaraya.com to
depict the membership and lead information of the teams involved in
building xaraya.
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
I hope, in the not too distant future, to update the
roadmap with some thoughts on the future of the xaraya project after
1.0.
Clearly, bug fixes, architectural changes, and new code waved off from <tt>xaraya1.0</tt>
will want to land during <tt>the 1.1 period</tt>. Xaraya also needs to
support the "xaraya-the-platform" side of the
coin for
more applications than the default-built
news-like-site.
I hope too that the use of xaraya technologies by innovators can make
significant
qualitative improvements (e.g., via things like RSS, SOAP, XML-RPC
etc.)
in how we all plan, build and organize them in our web-applications,
in our
file systems, and locked into application data formats, wherever such
data
may live.
There is life after 1.0 -- stay tuned!<br>
