  <title>General Configuration</title>

  <para>Now that we've installed Xaraya, we should begin to configure it. The
  pages in this section should help guide you through some of the more basic
  configuration options and start you on the path to customizing your Xaraya
  site.</para>

    <title>Configuration in Xaraya</title>

    <para>Every content system needs configuration. The configuration of
    Xaraya to your needs is done via options of the modules you have
    installed. The configuration of the Xaraya installation is a job for the
    Administrator of the site. Hence, all global configuration options are
    available via the administration area of Xaraya. In the Installation we
    have just done, you can access the administration options via the admin
    menu. We will use clickpaths to show you where to go. A clickpath contains
    all the seperate clicks you need to do. In this chapter, most clickpaths
    will start with Admin, meaning you will find the option in the Admin
    menu.</para>

    <title>Base Module Configuration</title>

    <para>The Base module holds the base configuration of you Xaraya
    installation. Base is the name for the module that defines the standard
    behaviour of your installation, the Base options. Base is part of the Core
    of Xaraya and cannot be removed.</para>

    <para><command>Admin-&gt;Base-&gt;Modifyconfig</command>: This panel
    allows you to change some of the settings controlling the core behaviour
    of the site.</para>

            <para>For this example, set the <emphasis>Default
            Module</emphasis> to "<guibutton>articles</guibutton>" so that the
            articles module is displayed when a visitor hits the site. Select
            "<guibutton>articles</guibutton>" from the drop-down list of
            available modules.</para>

            <para>Security level: From this drop-down list, configure the
            general security level for your site. If a user CHECKS the
            "Remember Me" box displayed in the login panel when logging in,
            the user's session is not purged for the duration set in the
            settings below. If a user does NOT check the "Remember Me" box
            when logging in, they must log into the site each time they visit.
            For our example, select "Medium" security.</para>

              <listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Low: Users stay logged in 'forever' (well, it's not

                time!).</para>

          </listitem>

            <para>Session duration (in days): This setting determines how long
            (in days) a user's session will last before it expires, forcing
            the user to re-log in with their existing username and password.
            Set the session duration to "<userinput>7</userinput>"
            days.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Session inactivity time out: If Xaraya detects that a user's
            session has been idle for a certain period of time and that the
            Security level is High or Medium, it will expire the session. This
            setting determines how many minutes Xaraya will wait before
            expiring the session due to inactivity. Set the inactivity time to
            "<userinput>90</userinput>" minutes.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Languages and Locales</para>

        <para>This tab shows the available locales on your site. You can
        download additional locales/language packs from the Xaraya website and
        enable them here. You can also choose the way your site deals with
        multiple languages. For now, choose the one language setting.</para>

            on your site, then set it here as the default WYSIWYG
            editor.</para>

            <para>A WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet editor is a friendly way to input
            text. Editors that you will allow to edit or create texts on your
            site will not have to worry about the formatting, as this is done
            in the editor much like an offline graphical text editor.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Load Historical functions should normally not be needed.
            Deprecated Xaraya functions are put in a set of historical
            functions, which can be activated via this checkbox. Only turn
            this on when needed.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The timezone setting is the timezone that the site will use
            to display times. If for instance your website is set for an
            audience in a country that is not on GMT, then you can choose to
            have a standard offset when displaying times.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release number to display: This is the number of extension
            releases to show in the Extension Release page. You will notice
            that you can set the display number in many places. This is one of
            them. When the number of items is more than this setting, they
            will not be shown (eg in Release Extensions), or Xaraya will
            produce a pager (eg in Articles).</para>

    <para><command>Admin-&gt;Base-&gt;System Information</command>: This panel
    displays a variety of information about the PHP installation on the site.
    Should you ever need to determine what version of PHP the site is running,
    or what modules are compiled into PHP, this is where to find that
    information. This information may be helpful if you need to submit a
    Xaraya bug report or a feature request.</para>

    <para><command>Admin-&gt;Base-&gt;Extension Releases</command>: This panel
    syndicates a news feed from www.xaraya.com listing recent module and theme
    releases. This information is very relevant if you use modules or themes
    that have a new version released.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Configure other modules</title>

    <para>Once the Base module settings are complete, you can move on to the
    other modules you will use.</para>

    <para>First we will set the way you will see your site in the themes
    module, then we will start adding the first content.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Themes</title>

      <para>Xaraya uses so-called themes to display your content. Themes are
      packages with templates and css files that dictate how the data from the
      database is eventually displayed to your users. You can download themes
      from the Xaraya website via the release module. They are also called
      extensions, as they extend the Xaraya Core.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>Visit the Xaraya themes website for recent themes: <ulink
          url="http://themes.xaraya.com/">http://themes.xaraya.com/</ulink>
          </para>
        </note>Themes are installed in the /themes/ directory of you
      installation.</para>

      <para>But first let's see which themes are available now. Go to the
      admin&gt;Themes&gt;Modify Config Settings. You will see that
      Xaraya_Classic is set Active and as the Default theme. You will also see
      the RSS theme and the print theme. These settings are ok for now.
      Xaraya_Classic is a nice theme to see how things work. You don't have to
      worry yet on your own theming. Read more on themes in the next
      chapter.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Modules module</title>

      <para>The Modules module shows all the available modules. It also
      configures the way they communicate with eachother via hooks. The hook
      configuration (we willl explain hooks later on) is the second option in
      the admin menu for the Modules module. </para>

      <para>Go to Admin-&gt;Modules. The admin list function will show you all
      the modules available in your installation, their state and give you
      short links to their configuration. For this moment, make sure the
      articles module is installed. If it is not installed, click on the
      Install command and follow the instructions.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>The module list is the same as you will see under /modules/ in
          your install. If you have downloaded and placed a new module in
          there, but cannot see it in the module listing, then press the
          "reload" button.</para>

          <para>If you like a fancy view on your module listing, try the Style
          "Icons" method. It will show icons instead of simple texts for the
          commands.</para>
        </note>That is it! You are now ready to follow the rest of the
      Guide.</para>
