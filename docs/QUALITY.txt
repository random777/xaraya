Xaraya Quality Document
====================

This documents the quality assurance process for the 1.0 Release for 
Xaraya.  The following release has been tested in both a closed testing process
and open testing process.  During the process several problems that normally would
have been missed have been identified and corrected.

Though there are still minor bugs documented on our Bug Tracker, the Xaraya
Quality Team feels comfortable in saying that there are no major bugs with functionality,
security, or system integrity.  

Even with the extensive testing process instituted with this release, we are providing
this software AS IS.  We provide no warranty, nor guarantee that this software will
operate as intended.

We hope that you appreciate the efforts of all involved, and invite you to take 
part in the next testing phase.
