PostNuke Quality Document
====================

This documents the quality assurance process for the .71 Rogue Release for 
PostNuke.  The following release has been tested in both a closed testing process
and open testing process.  During the process several problems that normally would
have been missed have been identified and corrected.

Though there are still minor bugs documented on our Bug Tracker, the PostNuke
Quality Team feels comfortable in saying that there are no major bugs with functionality,
security, or system integrity.  This process began in late January, and lasted until the 
middle of March to ensure the quality of PostNuke over multiple platforms, and
builds.

Even with the extensive testing process instituted with this release, we are providing
this software AS IS.  We provide no warranty, nor guarantee that this software will
operate as intended.

We hope that you appreciate the efforts of all involved, and invite you to take 
part in the next testing phase.
