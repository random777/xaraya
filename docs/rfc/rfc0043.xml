        This RFC presents a proposal for a Unique Identification System for Abstract
        Objects inside the Xaraya Architeture.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Across many of our database tables is perceptive the many cases where
        module name, and some other information like module item, or module variable
        is being used for uniquely identify a given set of informations.
        There are other cases using as much as 3 different inputs to generate a
        unique ID.
        The idea is to abstract this
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Pros">
      <t>
        The possibility of having the same unique identifier for an object across
        all of stored information in the Xaraya Architeture
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Cons">
      <t>
        There is a performance hit from bring this unique lookup from
        the particular table to a general system.
      </t>
      <t>
        This will double the number of SQL queries of the use cases, unless there is
        a query abstraction system present.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Idea">
      <t>
        The input is an associative array. For example:
        array( 'module'    => 'articles',
               'variable'  => 'pubtype1');

        or:
        array( 'module'    => 'articles',
               'object'    => 'pubtype1',
               'action'    => 'display');

        So there would be a table for 2*n number of inputs.
        (the key is one string to be looked for, and the values are other)
        All which will be assigned id numbers.

        And then select on a specialized table for the given number of
        inputs the unique ID looked for.
        
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternative Approach">
      <t>
       An alternative approach consists of using the (module + item type + item id)
       combination as unique identifier, and to rely on the original module to provide
       a relevant title and link to that module item via a standard user API function :
       &lt;module>_userapi_getitemlinks().
      </t>
      <t>
       This allows hook modules (or any other module) to present titles and links of
       other module items when they want to, without paying the price mentioned above
       for all queries.
      </t>
      <t>
       See also RFC 42 about the module hooks system.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternative Approach Comments">
      <t>
       The alternative approach is much better than the original one, which was
       unnecessarily complex...
      </t>
      <t>
       Although i think in the future, a more 'core' approach, which lends less flexibility
       to the modules would make xaraya able to use this feature more extensively.
       (For example in a Short-Urls to Intuitive-Urls transition)
