Release notes for Xaraya Core release 1.2.0-b1

Release 1.2.0-b1 (relevant changes from 1.1.5 onwards included here)

Possible incompatible changes, please check the following:
    * Installing: see the file INSTALL.txt
    * Upgrading : see the file UPGRADE.txt

*** Note: Code to upgrade from 1.1.x will be included in a later beta. ***

Major changes:
    * Minimum PHP requirement increased to 4.4.7.
    * New Installer theme.  Xaraya_Classic can now be uninstalled, as it is no longer tied to install and upgrade processes.
    * All templates renamed to .xt file extension.  Templates in non-core modules named .xd are still supported.
    * Support for JavaScript frameworks added in base/xarjavascriptapi.
    * jQuery added as default JS framework in Base module, with several plugins.
    

General fixes and improvements:
    * Upgrade ADODB to 4.991.
    * base/xarversionsapi changed to revolve around unified version number format (See RFC44, Section 6).
    * xarModURL() can now produce https URLs when requested.
    * Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org/) added to the base module and used throughout the core modules.  Additional Tango-style icons created as needed.
    * Module icons now live at [module]/xarimages/[modname].png.  Tango-style PNG icons for core modules added at this location.  Old-style admin.gif icons still supported.
    * Several javascript files replaced with jQuery code and/or plugins:
        * base/calendar.js
        * base/checkall.js
        * base/confirmlink.js
        * base/formcheck.js
        * base/orderitem.js
        * base/toggle.js
        * base/xmlhttprequest.js
    * DD Calendar property now uses jQuery plugin ui.datepicker.
    * DD OrderSelect property uses custom jQuery code.
    * Tree displays in Roles and Privileges now use jQuery TreeView plugin.
    * Inline JavaScript event handlers in core modules reduced from 171 to 5 (4 are in unused files).
    * Other UI enhancements made possible with JS framework (jQuery).
    * In menus, the module category "Global" has been renamed to "System".
    * Several new classes added to theme CSS:
        * .xar-items: Applied wherever data items are displayed in a table.
        * .xar-item-actions: Applied to the table cell which contains the action (modify, delete, etc) links for each item, typically the right-most cell.
        * .xar-item-controls: Applied to parent elements of inputs used to control or filter displayed items.  Examples are the horizontal tables displayed at the top of the UI in many admin-list functions.
        * .xar-form-footer: Applied to parent elements of buttons used to control a form (at the bottom of the form).
        * .xar-icon: Applied to icon img elements or their immediate parent, such as links.
        * .xar-icon-disabled: Applied to icon img elements or their immediate parent when the represented action is not allowed.
