      <t>The EU directive on data protection contains some requirements which may have
	an impact on our code base. This  RFC documents these requirements and their
	propasals on how to comply with them in Xaraya.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	This document proposes certain changes to the Xaraya source code to make the
	users module compliant with the EU directive on data protection. This does
	not imply that Xaraya sites without these changes cannot comply with the
	directive. The changes proposed simply make it easier to do so, primarily by
	giving the users enhanced functionality to manage personal data they submit.
	This makes life easier for the site administrator, who otherwise has the
	onus to comply with user requests concerning personal data.
      </t>
      <t>
	The directive is quite complex and, depending on the type and purpose of the
	data collected, can be quite onerous. The changes proposed in this document
	purport to take into account common situations encountered by most
	organizations that will run Xaraya. With this in mind, what follows is a
	simplified summary of the major points of the directive that will be used to
	define the requirements of a compliant users module.
      </t>
      <t>
	For special situations the directive in its entirety may need to be taken
	into account. The directive can be found here:
	http://www.privacy.org/pi/intl_orgs/ec/final_EU_Data_Protection.html
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Implications of the Directive">
      <t>
	For the purpose at hand the directive distinguishes between the following
	subjects (we take subject to mean a natural or legal person):
	<list>
	  <t>
	    Data Subject: the natural person whose personal data is the object
	    of the directive.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Controller: the subject that determines the purposes and means of
	    the processing of personal data.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Processor: the subject that processes personal data on behalf of
	    the controller.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Recipient: the subject to whom data are disclosed.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	The directive applies to any and all processing of personal data, with some
	exceptions. Exempted are a number of national or EU institutions themselves
	(!), and strictly personal or household uses of personal data.
      </t>
      <t>
	While we can make a module EU compliant, this does not necessarily mean that
	any use of the module is necessarily legal in all cases. National
	legislation may supercede the directive. What may be allowed by the
	directive, e.g. processing of personal data "revealing racial or ethnic
	origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union
	membership" with the user's consent, may be prohibited by national law. Such
	considerations are excluded from this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	Also excluded from this discussion is the obligation that a site may or may
	not have to notify a supervisory authority as described by the directive.
	[section IX]
      </t>
      <t>
	The directive distinguishes between data collected from the user and data
	about the user collected from other sources. For our purpose only the former
	is relevant, i.e. data submitted by users registering on a site.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Main Points">
      <t>
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    The user must give his/her unambiguous consent to the processing
	    of his/her personal data.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The user must be told to what end the data will be used.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The user must be told whether submitting the data is mandatory or
	    not, and the consequences of submitting or not submitting the data.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The user must be told who the recipients of the data will be.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The user must have the right to access and modify the data.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The user has the right to object at any time to the processing of
	    the data. Accordingly "Where there is a justified objection, the processing
	    instigated by the controller may no longer involve those data".
	  </t>
