		<section title="Introduction ">
			<t>
			   All ?xxx numbers refer to the basic documents in section 7.
   We read through the articles on http://www.postnuke.com, its forum
   threads, feature requests on sourceforge and the developers mailing
   list.
   The following RFC is a first summary and contains some solution
   proposals either compiled from the basic documents or from general
   definitions concerning comments systems / forums.

		<section title="List of requirements for the Rating API">
			<t>
			    The main objective of this API is to provide a small, yet flexible
    codebase for adding rating functionality to modules. Rating is a
    powerful organisational concept, and goes well together with
    categories to sift through large amounts of content. In a community
    setting, it helps to identify valuable elements of the community,
    and to protect the community from disturbances.
    That said, there are a lot of approaches to rating, from the very
    simple to the highly sophisticated. [1], [4]
    Not all rating types are suited for the same problems so it would be
    feasible to make parts of this API pluggable to allow for the
    addition of different rating types.
    The API should be transparent to all modules that want to use it,
    and vice versa.
    Following is a list of requirements broadly grouped into
    categories.
    - let users rate articles [5]
    - let users rate submissions [6]
    - provide a moderation system based on Karma [7]
    - promote user permissions by various measures [8]
    - approve new users [9]
    - give points to users based on activity [10]
    - create friends / foes list [12], [13]
    - select site content by rating for syndication [16]
    - let users rate an item only once [17]
    - customize display of content based on rating [17]
    - devise anti-groupthink measures [17]

			<t>
			    3a. Trust Networks
    See Appendix 1 [14] for one possible approach. It is
    straight out of the sourceforge.net code [2] Its just
    one idea.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Solution proposals - functions">
			<t>
			    4a. Trust Networks
    Networks of Trust have been shown to be rather resilient
    to attack. [3] It may be feasible to reuse the PHP
    port of the advogato.org Network of Trust that sourceforge.net
    uses. [2] See Appendix 2 [15] for the code.
    4b. Distributed Trust Networks
    [4] Takes the notion of Trust Network one step further
    by suggesting to distribute the Trust Network over several
    sites.

		<section title="Relationship of the API to other areas">
			<t>
			    5a. Categories API
    There seem to be some overlaps with the Categories API,
    as both Ratings and Categories can be thought of as
    metadata. [11]
    5b. Permissions System
    Ratings have to have an impact on user permissions in the
    end to be effective. There should be ways to assign permissions
    based on ratings. This is a difficult area fraught with pitfalls,
    as Jim McDonald has pointed out. Worth considering though.
