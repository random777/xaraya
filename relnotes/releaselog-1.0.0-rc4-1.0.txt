      bug   : short info
      ---   | ----------
    * [N/A] : core api function xarUserSetNavigationTheme was incorrect
    * [N/A] : core api function xarTplGetThemeName was incorrect
    * [N/A] : several fixes to dd properties (countrylist, checkbox mask, urlicon)
    * [N/A] : correction to expression evaluation in xar:set and xar:var tags. 
              (where more '$' chars were present in variable names)
    * [2204]: provisions for non 'Admin' named Admins, this probably will not affect any sites younger than 8 months or so.
    * [4881]: no preset for the basedir when uploads is hooked. (fileupload property)
    * [4898]: fix for default maxsize in text/file upload dd properties
    * [4951]: no db cache flush on moduservars, making it consistent behaviour with other code in the same subsystem
    * [5015]: optional url parameter 'table' for modifyprop function to allow extra tables to see as datasources, 
              even if they are not registered xar tables.
    * [5053]: disabled UI of group hooks, as the code doesnt support those.
    * [5074]: typing error in MLS backend code.
    * [5087]: typing error in roles purging templates
    * [5097]: translations in dd properties which include ML constructs were not translated
    * [5109]: workaround for certain hosting setups where an incorrect https setting caused installer to switch to https
    * [5111]: included templates lost translation, centralized the code for loading the translations 
              in xarTemplate.php, so there is one entry point for loading wrt templates 
    * [5117]: typing error in new privilege template
    * [5119]: variable checks for RDF feed (base module)
