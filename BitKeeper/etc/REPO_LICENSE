    The repository you are working in is a "clone" of the Xaraya core reference
    repository on the Xaraya server. The revision control system this repository
    uses is a distributed revision control system which means that any change
    committed in any clones based on that reference repository could ultimately
    reach the parent repository from where it was orginally cloned.

    The reference repository on the Xaraya server contains code which is governed
    by a Joint Copyright Agreement (JCA)  between its committers and the Digital

    you should take a number of steps to make sure you can participate in the 
    Joint Copyright Agreement.

    b.) Make sure you are entitled to share the copyright of your code.
    c.) Contact the DDF through legal@ddfoundation.org for the appropriate transfer
        forms or get them from http://ddfoundation.org/jca

    If you do not want to participate in the Joint Copyright Agreement, you should
    take appropriate measures to make sure your changes can not reach the Xaraya
    Core Reference repository. Your patches can only be accepted in the reference
    repository if you participate in the JCA
