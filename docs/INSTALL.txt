PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING Xaraya



Xaraya: adam_baum Beta (.9.0.6)
==================================

   Xaraya is an Open Source application framework.  Xaraya started as a fork of PostNuke (http://www.postnuke.com) and PHPNuke (http://www.phpnuke.org).  Xaraya provides many enhancements and improvements over the two systems and is a complete rewrite from the ground up. Xaraya is still undergoing development, but a large number of core functions are now stabilizing and a complete API for third-party developers is now in place.

   If you would like to help develop this software, please visit our homepage at http://www.Xaraya.com, or send email to info@xaraya.com .

   You can also visit us in channel #support or #chat, on our IRC Server irc.Xaraya.com.

   More detailed installation instructions can be found in XarayaDocs.txt, included with this release. Before installing, read that document for a clearer understanding of the directory structure of this distribution and installation options available to you.

New Installation
================

   First Xaraya needs to be copied to your webserver. Not all files need to be copied - just the contents of the html subdirectory included in this package. The contents of that directory can be copied directly to your webserver document root or they can be put in a subdirectory.

   Xaraya has a fully graphical install process to provide a simple set of steps to get your site up and running.

   Then, we can run the installation, depending on what you copied where:
  [everything in docroot]         http://www.foo.com/html/install.php
  [only html content in docroot]  http://www.foo.com/install.php
  [everything in subdir]          http://www.foo.com/bar/html/install.php
  [only html content in subdir]   http://www.foo.com/bar/install.php

   To install your Xaraya system, run the appropriate path to install.php from your browser to start the installation process.  The exact URL depends on your site, but the examples above should illustrate how to work out what the correct path will be.

   Follow the instructions in the installation script and when prompted for either a new install or an upgrade select 'new install'.  The installer will create the required database tables and set up the account for the person who will act as the administrator of the site.  Once complete you should be able to start using your Xaraya site immediately.

   Please note that the option to "create the database" is related to whether you need the installer to create the database itself first or whether it can just go ahead and populate an already existing database.

Upgrades
========

   Please visit the #support channel for information on upgrading from PostNuke to Xaraya.

   DB Changes between versions
   ----------------------------------------------------
   .9.0.0 -> .9.0.2 Small article and permissions changes.
   .9.0.2 -> .9.0.3 Added syndication block for RSS output.
   .9.0.3 -> .9.0.4 Small changes to article masks
   .9.0.4 -> .9.0.5 Changes to the priviliges.
            Removal of the old waiting content ideas
            for new and improved version.
   .9.0.5 -> .9.0.6 None
   ----------------------------------------------------

   - Before upgrading:
     Back-up all old files and the database.
     Go to your articles module and press "update" in the config section to ensure that old pubtype configs are updated from their .900 states.

   - To upgrade from a previous Xaraya Version replace all files and modules EXCEPT /html/var/config.system.php .
   - Please note the upgrade script looks at the current DB settings and loads the site so maintaining the config.system.php is necessary to upgrade between versions.
   - Log in with administration rights.
   - Point your directory to upgrade.php in your root directory.
   - Follow instructions from there.
   - Remember to remove upgrade.php and install.php from your installation.
   - Go to your modules admin and regenerate.
   - Upgrade the required modules that are indicated by the status of upgrade.


Caution
=======

   Versions of PostNuke and other derivatives often include plugins that alter the database core tables through adding fields, changing names, etc. It should be noted that Xaraya does not support any modification of the core tables (those that come with this Xaraya distribution) or direct access to the core database tables.  APIs are provided for developers to use for these purposes, so that future planned changes will have a minimal impact on third-party added functionality, and these APIs should be used at all times.

Common Installation Errors
==========================

   If you are having difficulties getting past the boot phase, specifically errors about not being able to open the CACHEKEYS file for writing, try deleting the file:
    html/var/templates/CACHEKEYS

   The html/var/cache/rss and html/var/cache/templates both need to be writable and executable, along with the config.system.php file.

   If you have a problem with install of your databases, and you recieve a message:

    ErrorNo: 1142, Message:Database error while executing: 'CREATE INDEX i_base_xar_uid ON xar_session_info (xar_uid)'; error description is: 'index command denied to user: 'debeemster@localhost' for table 'xar_session_info''.

   This is an indication that you or your host does not allow the permission in the database to create indexes.  The system will suffer from slow performance without the DB index, and it is in your host's best interest to allow them.
