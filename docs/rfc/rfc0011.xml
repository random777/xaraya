		<section title="Introduction ">
			<t>
			   All ?xxx numbers refer to the basic documents in section 7.
   We read through the articles on http://www.postnuke.com, its forum
   threads, feature requests on sourceforge and the developers mailing
   list.
   The following RFC is a first summary and contains some solution
   proposals either compiled from the basic documents or from general
   definitions concerning comments systems / forums.

		<section title="List of requirements for the Admin System">

			    Following is a list of requirements broadly grouped into
    categories.

			 The purpose of a module classification scheme is:
 *to assist admins to choose the right kind of module for the right task
 *help a new developer recognise what is a modules's function and its possible relation to other modules
 *most importantly, to help the release personnel to be able to decide without a doubt which category/class a
 module belongs to, what other modules can be bundled with it, and which modules can be classified as
 a) important and self-sufficient (core-like)
 b) extensions &amp; utilities
 c) administrative
 d) other/non-essential etc.,
 Add something to the modules specification stating that
 each modules needs to have some sort of categorisation
 information available to make it easy to arrange these
 items in a more structured way.
 In pnversion.php:
$modversion?'category' = 1; 
Where integers are: 
 1. Global
    - Settings
    - Banners
    - Languages
    - Modules
    - Blocks
 2. Users &amp; Groups
