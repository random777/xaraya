Second proposal, taking the repository discussion into account:

1. Core distribution
====================
Goal: Minimal distribution for framework 
----------------------------------------
adminpanels
authsystem
base
blocks
dynamicdata
installer
mail
modules
privileges
roles
sniffer
themes

2. Classic distribution (or base distribution)
==============================================
Goal: basic distribution to set up a 'typical portal'
-----------------------------------------------------
Contains core plus:

autolinks
bloggerapi
categories

headlines

3. Full distribution

4. Language packs
=================
Language packs are distributed separately. All other distributions
now include six locales:
de_DE.utf-8, en_US.iso8859-1, en_US.utf-8, nl_NL.utf_8, pt_BR.utf-8
and ru_RU.utf-8.

5. Theme packs
==============
Theme packs are distributed separately. All other distribution are 
based on Xaraya_Classic theme.


Modules which are not in 'working' condition, by my poor judgement 
(it can mean both 'unknown' and 'not working')
and thus are not registered for any distribution yet. Please prove 
me wrong if your module is listed and you want to have it included 
in one of the distributions.

formcontrols - ? no xarversion
metaweblogapi - does nothing
soapserver - does nothing
