    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        Several terms are used in RFC documents. This section tries to explain them.
      </t>
      
      <section title="RFC (Request For Comment)">
        <t>
          Outlines the proposal/idea for comment. Stakeholders comment
          as needed. The lead author collects comments and incorporates
          them into the document. Through the RFC process, additional
          reviewers/stakeholders may be identified. In this case, the
          RFC is also submitted for their review. When all comments have
          been captured, integrated/addressed, the RFC should represent
          the best available solution. The status (category) of the RFC continuously
          reflects how the content should be interpreted. See RFC2026 (
          http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt ) for the 'master'
          process on which we base our meaning of RFCs. Obviously we dont have the
          master process implemented, but that document will give you a very good
          picture on how RFCs should be treated.

      <section anchor="categories" title="Categories">
        <t>
            RFCs are classified in a number of categories to signal their use
            and status. These categories are usually abbreviated like so:
            <list>
                <t>
                    <spanx style="verb">info</spanx>: Informational. 
                    This can be anything from a collection of interesting notes to a full fledged protocol
                    description. They however do <spanx style="strong">NOT</spanx> describe any sort of
                    standard to adhere to.
                </t>
                <t>
                    <spanx style="verb">historic</spanx>: Historic. 
                    This RFC is either replaced by a newer version or is not applicable 
                    anymore. It is left for reference purposes only.
                </t>
                <t>
                    <spanx style="verb">std</spanx>: Standard.
                    These are the real deal. What is documented in these RFCs is official and considered a standard.
                </t>                
                <t>
                    <spanx style="verb">bcp</spanx>: Best Current Practice.
                    These documents describe procedures and practices to give instructions what has shown to work well,
                    not excluding other ways of achieving the same result.
                </t>
                <t>
                    <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>: Experimental.
                    Experimental are RFCs which, in theory, describe possible standards, but there has been no
                    effort to implement or endorse what is described.
