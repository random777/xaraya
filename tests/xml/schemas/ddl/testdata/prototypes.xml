        If a table needs an autoincrement/serial/sequenced id 
        From within your schema, use it like this:
        
        <column ref="auto_id_column"/>
        
        and it will be generated automagically for you.

      <description>
          This column generates numbers automatically. A nameless id. No
          meaning should be given to the number, it is 'just a number'
