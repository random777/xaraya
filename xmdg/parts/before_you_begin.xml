    <title>Choose a name</title>

    <para>Choosing a name for your module is important, as this is the main
    way that your module will be known throughout the Xaraya community. The
    name should relate to the functionality that the module provides, but also
    be specific enough to be able to discern it from separate modules that
    might offer similar functionality. Module names are case-sensitive. All
    modules names are lower-case only.</para>

    <title>Register your module</title>

    <para>Registering your module is not compulsory, but it is a very good
    idea. By registering your module, you can ensure that no other official
    Xaraya module will take the name that you have chosen for your module. Two
    modules with the same name will not operate correctly on a single Xaraya
    site, so it is beneficial to both yourself and the Xaraya community in
    general to have a unique name. You may register your module via the
    release module on <ulink url="???">http://www.xaraya.com/</ulink></para>
