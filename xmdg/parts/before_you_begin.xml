    <title>Choose a name</title>

    <para>Choosing a name for your module is important, as this is the main
    way that your module will be known throughout the Xaraya community. The
    name should relate to the functionality that the module provides, but also
    be specific enough to be able to discern it from separate modules that
    might offer similar functionality. All modules names are lower-case
    only.</para>

    <para>You can offer site admins the possibility to use an alias for your
    module. The alias will be used then instead of the module name.</para>

    <title>Register your module</title>

    <para>Registering your module is not compulsory, but it is a very good
    idea. By registering your module, you can ensure that no other official
    Xaraya module will take the name that you have chosen for your module. Two
    modules with the same name will not operate correctly on a single Xaraya
    site, so it is beneficial to both yourself and the Xaraya community in
    general to have a unique name. You may register your module via the
    release module on <ulink url="???">http://www.xaraya.com/</ulink></para>

      <title>Releasing your module</title>

      <para>If you have registered you module/extension, and if you want to
      release a version, then you can use the Xaraya Release module. This way,
      your release will be announced to all Xaraya installs. The Release
      module will place an announcement on the xaraya.com frontpage and make
      an accouncement in the RSS feed.</para>

      <para>You will have to think of some things before releasing: </para>
